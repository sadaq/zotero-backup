Although, some studies on hypertension have been conducted in Bangladesh, there is a lack of scientific evidence in the adult student population that was missing from the previous and recent national cross-sectional studies. Moreover, the specific risk factors of hypertension in the Bangladeshi adults still need to be investigated. This study was conducted to estimate hypertension prevalence among adult students in Bangladesh and to test the hypothesis of Luke et al. (Hypertension 43:555–560, 2004) that basal metabolic rate (BMR) and blood pressure are positively associated independent of body size.\nMethod: The data was collected on 184 adult university students (118 female and 66 male) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Anthropometric, BMR details and an average of at least two blood pressure measurements were obtained. Hypertension was defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg.\nResults: Overall, 6.5% of participants had hypertension with significantly (p < 0.001) higher prevalence in male (12.1%) than in the female (3.4%) students. Age and BMI showed positive and significant correlation with hypertension among the students. When adjusted for body mass index (BMI), as well as other potentially confounding variables such as age, sex, smoking status and degree of urbanization, BMR was positively correlated with SBP and DBP (p < 0.001). Thus, higher BMR is associated with SBP and DBP; this is opposite the well documented inverse relationship between physical activity and blood pressure. If the influence of BMR on blood pressure is confirmed, the systematically elevated BMR might be an important predictor that can explain relatively high blood pressure and hypertension in humans.\nConclusion: This study reports the prevalence and associated risk factors of hypertension in the Bangladeshi adult students. The study also showed a positive association between BMR and blood pressure among the participants. A large scale longitudinal study across the country is needed to find out the underlying causes of hypertension in the Bangladeshi adults. In addition, comprehensive and integrated intervention programs focusing on modifiable risk factors are recommended to make awareness and prevent hypertension.","title":"Hypertension prevalence and influence of basal metabolic rate on blood pressure among adult students in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"Nurshad","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shakil","lastName":"Mahmood","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M.","lastName":"Manirujjaman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rasheda","lastName":"Perveen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Al Nahid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shamim","lastName":"Ahmed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Farida Adib","lastName":"Khanum","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mustafizur","lastName":"Rahman","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T03:45:34Z","dateModified":"2018-09-03T04:37:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/PHETZV4E","itemID":273,"key":"PHETZV4E"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882621834,"version":0},"$loki":5},{"itemID":249,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.nature.com/articles/1001057","volume":"14","issue":"10-11","pages":"749-763","publicationTitle":"Journal of Human Hypertension","ISSN":"0950-9240, 1476-5527","date":"10/2000","DOI":"10.1038/sj.jhh.1001057","accessDate":"2018-08-31T02:06:24Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Hypertension and stroke in Asia: prevalence, control and strategies in developing countries for prevention","shortTitle":"Hypertension and stroke in Asia","creators":[{"firstName":"Rb","lastName":"Singh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Il","lastName":"Suh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Vp","lastName":"Singh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S","lastName":"Chaithiraphan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"P","lastName":"Laothavorn","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rg","lastName":"Sy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Babilonia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ara","lastName":"Rahman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S","lastName":"Sheikh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"B","lastName":"Tomlinson","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"N","lastName":"Sarraf-Zadigan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/QEKFU8V5"]},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T02:06:24Z","dateModified":"2018-08-31T10:04:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/DDAZNCGS","itemID":249,"key":"DDAZNCGS"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882621850,"version":0},"$loki":6},{"itemID":275,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005792-201409030-00002","volume":"93","issue":"13","pages":"e74","publicationTitle":"Medicine","ISSN":"0025-7974","date":"09/2014","DOI":"10.1097/MD.0000000000000074","accessDate":"2018-08-31T03:50:45Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Hypertension is a leading attributable risk factor for mortality in South Asia.

In Bangladesh, approximately 20% of adult and 40–65% of elderly people suffer from HTN. High incidence of metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle-related factors like obesity, high salt intake, and less physical activity may play important role in the pathophysiology of HTN. The association of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and low birth weight with blood pressure has been studied inadequately. Studies have found relationship between mass arsenic poisoning and HTN. Hypovitaminosis D presumably plays role in the aetiopathogenesis of HTN in Bangladeshi population. South Asians appear to respond to antihypertensive therapy in a similar manner to the Whites. The latest National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline advocates a calcium-channel blocker as step 1 antihypertensive treatment to people aged ≥ 55 years and an ACE inhibitor or a low-cost angiotensin-II receptor blocker for the younger people. Calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers have been found to be the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs in Bangladesh. Non-adherence to the standard guidelines and irrational drug prescribing are likely to be important. On the other hand, non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is quite high. At the advent of the new millennium, we are really unaware of our real situation. Large-scale, preferably, nation-wide survey and clinical research are needed to explore the different aspects of HTN in Bangladesh.","title":"Hypertension in Bangladesh: a review","shortTitle":"Hypertension in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"A.K.M.

Design: Longitudinal study. Setting: The study was carried out in icddr,b surveillance sites at rural Matlab in Chandpur district and semi-urban Kamalapur in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants: Randomly selected men and non-pregnant women aged 20 years or older without any acute illness or history of any vascular events such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction. Main outcome measure: Hypertension was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or as self-reported hypertension under medication. We advised patients to seek care from a qualified provider and to adopt a healthy lifestyle. We compared changes in BP from baseline to follow-up at around 6 months.\nResults: Overall, 17.1% (n=287) of participants had hypertension at baseline with significantly higher prevalence in the semi-urban than in the rural population (23.6% vs 10.8%; p<0.001); half were unaware of their condition. At follow-up, 83% (n=204) reported a visit to any healthcare provider. In the semi-urban area, a higher proportion of patients visited medically qualified practitioners than in the rural area (76.7% vs 36.6%, p<0.000). SBP (−3.3±20.7 mm Hg; p<0.01) and DBP (−2.0±13.0 mm Hg; p<0.02) were lower at follow-up. Those who visited medically qualified practitioners had significant SBP (−3.9±22.4 mm Hg; p<0.03) and DBP (−2.7±14.1 mm Hg; p<0.02) reduction. BP reduction did not reach statistical significance among those visiting a pharmacist or their village doctors. Overall, half of the patients with hypertension achieved the BP control goal (BP<140/90 mm Hg).\nConclusions: Awareness and simple health messages increase provider visit, reduce blood pressure and improve BP control in hypertensive Bangladeshis.

Although some epidemiological studies on hypertension have been conducted in Bangladesh, the factors associated with hypertension in this nation remain unclear. We aimed to determine the factors associated with hypertension among the adults in Bangladesh.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the nationally representative 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). A total of 7,839 (3,964 women and 3,875 men) adults aged 35 years and older who participated in the survey was included. Hypertension was defined by a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and/or, receipt of an anti-hypertensive medication at time of the survey. The degree of association between the risk factors and the outcome was assessed by the odd ratio (OR) obtained from the bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models.\nResults: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 26.4 %, and the prevalence was higher in women (32.4 %) than men (20.3 %). Study participants with the age group of 60–69 years had higher odds of having hypertension (AOR: 3.77, 95 % CI: 3.01–4.72) than the age group 35–39 years. Moreover, individuals who had higher educational attainment (AOR: 1.63, 95 % C.I: 1.25–2.14) and higher wealth status (AOR = 1.91, 95 % CI: 1.54–2.38) had higher odds of having hypertension than the individuals with no education and lower social status, respectively. The analysis also showed that high BMI (AOR: 2.19, 95 % C.I: 1.87–2.57) and having diabetes (AOR: 1.54, 95 % C.I: 1.31–1.83) were associated with the increasing risk of hypertension.\nConclusions: Our study shows that the risk of hypertension was significantly associated with older age, sex, education, place of residence, working status, wealth index, BMI, and diabetes. Moreover, hypertension is largely untreated, especially in rural settings. The health system needs to develop appropriate strategies including early diagnosis, awareness via mass media, and health education programs for changing lifestyles should be initiated for older age, wealthy, and/or higher educated individuals in Bangladesh. Moreover, area-specific longitudinal research is necessary to find out the underlying causes of regional variations.","title":"Hypertension among adults in Bangladesh: evidence from a national cross-sectional survey","shortTitle":"Hypertension among adults in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"Muhammad Abdul Baker","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Md.

Despite Matlab’s significant advances in socio-demographic indicators, emergence of NCDs and mortality associated with it would be the major cause for concern in the coming years.","title":"Epidemiological transition in rural Bangladesh, 1986–2006","creators":[{"firstName":"Zunaid Ahsan","lastName":"Karar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nurul","lastName":"Alam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kim Streatfield","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/7TAMJ4FC"]},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T04:02:55Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:16:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/DZ2KS58E","itemID":289,"key":"DZ2KS58E"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882621956,"version":0},"$loki":15},{"itemID":380,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"conferencePaper","volume":"17","pages":"15–19","date":"2013","title":"Prevalence of hypertension among the Bangladeshi adult population: a meta-analysis","proceedingsTitle":"Regional Health Forum","creators":[{"firstName":"Abu Talebi","lastName":"Moniruzzamani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shahadur","lastName":"Rahmani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Amitava","lastName":"Acharyyai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ferdous Ara","lastName":"Islami","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"MSAM","lastName":"Ahmedi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M Mostafa","lastName":"Zamanii","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-04T08:48:39Z","dateModified":"2018-09-04T08:48:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/Q5EGSXGW","itemID":380,"key":"Q5EGSXGW"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882621978,"version":0},"$loki":16},{"itemID":299,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1161/01.HYP.0000107251.49515.c2","volume":"42","issue":"6","pages":"1206-1252","publicationTitle":"Hypertension","ISSN":"0194-911X, 1524-4563","date":"2003","DOI":"10.1161/01.HYP.0000107251.49515.c2","accessDate":"2018-08-31T04:18:09Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure","creators":[{"firstName":"A.

The key messages of this report are: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >140 mmHg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP (DBP); beginning at 115/75 mmHg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mmHg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90 percent lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 80–89 mmHg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions, which are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mmHg, or <130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease); for patients whose BP is >20 mmHg above the SBP goal or 10 mmHg above the DBP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will only be controlled if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.","title":"The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"National High Blood Pressure Education Program","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Hypertension classification"}],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-29T05:00:45Z","dateModified":"2018-09-03T04:33:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/HYI87RYY","itemID":244,"key":"HYI87RYY"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622030,"version":0},"$loki":22},{"itemID":326,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"webpage","url":"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings","date":"2018","accessDate":"2018-08-31T11:21:51Z","language":"en","abstractNote":"Use our blood pressure chart to learn what your blood pressure numbers mean.

The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake.

However, only one-third of the normotensive subjects were reported to show salt-sensitivity in their blood pressure. Many factors have been proposed as causes of salt-sensitive hypertension, but none of them provides a satisfactory explanation. We propose, on the basis of accumulated data, that the reduced activity of the kallikrein-kinin system in the kidney may provide this link. Renal kallikrein is secreted by the distal connecting tubular cells and all kallikrein-kinin system components are distributed along the collecting ducts in the distal nephron. Bradykinin generated is immediately destroyed by carboxypeptidase Y-like exopeptidase and neutral endopeptidase, both quite independent from the kininases in plasma, such as angiotensin converting enzyme. The salt-sensitivity of the blood pressure depends largely upon ethnicity and potassium intake. Interestingly, potassium and ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel blockers accelerate renal kallikrein secretion and suppress blood pressure rises in animal hypertension models. Measurement of urinary kallikrein may become necessary in salt-sensitive normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Furthermore, pharmaceutical development of renal kallikrein releasers, such as KATP channel blockers, and renal kininase inhibitors, such as ebelactone B, may lead to the development of novel antihypertensive drugs.","title":"A Missing Link Between a High Salt Intake and Blood Pressure Increase","creators":[{"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Katori","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Majima","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-01T08:01:47Z","dateModified":"2018-09-01T08:01:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/BA9759RH","itemID":345,"key":"BA9759RH"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622084,"version":0},"$loki":29},{"itemID":346,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"webpage","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/prevention/","date":"23 Oct 2017, 10:30 a.m.","accessDate":"2018-09-01T08:05:11Z","language":"en","abstractNote":"Find out about the lifestyle changes you can make to prevent and reduce high blood pressure.","websiteTitle":"nhs.uk","title":"Prevention","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"nhs","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-01T08:05:11Z","dateModified":"2018-09-01T08:12:47Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/BXUSWT9L","itemID":346,"key":"BXUSWT9L"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622090,"version":0},"$loki":30},{"itemID":323,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172631","volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":"e0172631","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","date":"2017-2-23","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0172631","accessDate":"2018-08-31T10:45:23Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation likely contributes to cardiovascular (CV) mortality, however it has remained unknown whether a dose-response relationship exists between serum GGT and CV mortality.\nMethods We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases for prospective cohort studies published up to October 2, 2016. Summary hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed effects model. Findings Nine prospective studies, including 527,589 participants and more than 7,011 cases, were included in this meta-analysis. For the moderate, high, and highest levels of GGT, the pooled HRs of CV mortality were 1.11 (95% CI = 1.04–1.19), 1.29 (95% CI = 1.21–1.38) and 1.59 (95% CI = 1.47–1.72), respectively (all p < 0.05 as compared to the lowest levels of GGT). Additionally, the HR per incremental increase of GGT by 10 U/L was 1.10 (95% CI = 1.08–1.11). Evidence of a positive relationship with nonlinear trend for GGT elevation with CV mortality in females was found (P = 0.04 for nonlinearity). However, a linear model was better fit to illustrate the GGT-CV mortality among males (P = 0.304 for nonlinearity).\nConclusions These findings indicate that serum GGT activity within the reference

Among the liver enzymes, important advances have especially been made in understanding the physiological functions of GGT. The primary role of GGT is the extracellular catabolism of glutathione, the major thiol antioxidant in mammalian cells, which plays a relevant role in protecting cells against oxidants produced during normal metabolism; GGT, therefore, plays an important role in cellular defence. Beyond its physiological functions, circulating serum GGT has been linked to a remarkable array of chronic conditions and diseases, which include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, vascular and nonvascular diseases and mortality outcomes. This review summarizes the available epidemiological and genetic evidence for the associations between GGT and these adverse outcomes, the postulated biologic mechanisms underlying these associations, outlines areas of outstanding uncertainty and the implications for clinical practice.","title":"Gamma-glutamyltransferase-friend or foe within?","creators":[{"firstName":"Setor K.","lastName":"Kunutsor","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-03T05:42:45Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:17:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/ZJLAYVIR","itemID":364,"key":"ZJLAYVIR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622312,"version":0},"$loki":40},{"itemID":313,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10408368009108725","volume":"12","issue":"1","pages":"1-58","publicationTitle":"CRC Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences","ISSN":"0590-8191","date":"1980","DOI":"10.3109/10408368009108725","accessDate":"2018-08-31T08:52:32Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Structural, Functional, and Clinical Aspects of γ-Glutamyltransferase","creators":[{"firstName":"David M.","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"GGT information"}],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T08:52:32Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:14:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/GEDYAG2S","itemID":313,"key":"GEDYAG2S"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622316,"version":0},"$loki":41},{"itemID":198,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://atm.amegroups.com/article/view/12996/13456","volume":"4","issue":"24","pages":"481-481","publicationTitle":"Annals of Translational Medicine","ISSN":"23055839, 23055847","date":"12/2016","DOI":"10.21037/atm.2016.12.27","accessDate":"2018-08-20T12:58:20Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme located on the external surface of cellular membranes. GGT contributes in maintaining the physiological concentrations of cytoplasmic glutathione and cellular defense against oxidative stress via cleavage of extracellular glutathione and increased availability of amino acids for its intracellular synthesis. Increased GGT activity is a marker of antioxidant inadequacy and increased oxidative stress. Ample evidence suggests that elevated GGT activity is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, arterial hypertension, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause and CVD-related mortality. The evidence is weaker for an association between elevated GGT activity and acute ischemic events and myocardial infarction. The risk for CVD or CVD-related mortality mediated by GGT may be explained by the close correlation of GGT with conventional CVD risk factors and various comorbidities, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption, oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. The finding of GGT activity in atherosclerotic plaques and correlation of intra-plaque GGT activity with histological indexes of plaque instability may suggest a participation of GGT in the pathophysiology of CVD, particularly atherosclerosis. However, whether GGT has a direct role in the pathophysiology of CVD or it is an epiphenomenon of coexisting CVD risk factors or comorbidities remains unknown and Hill’s criteria of causality relationship between GGT and CVD are not fulfilled. The exploration whether GGT provides prognostic information on top of the information provided by known cardiovascular risk factors regarding the CVD or CVD-related outcome and exploration of molecular mechanisms of GGT involvement in the pathophysiology of CVD and eventual use of interventions to reduce circulating GGT activity remain a duty of future studies.","title":"Gamma-glutamyl transferase and cardiovascular disease","creators":[{"firstName":"Gjin","lastName":"Ndrepepa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Kastrati","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T12:58:20Z","dateModified":"2018-08-20T12:58:21Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/R96GMI8K","itemID":198,"key":"R96GMI8K"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622322,"version":0},"$loki":42},{"itemID":450,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.2337/diacare.27.6.1427","volume":"27","issue":"6","pages":"1427-1432","publicationTitle":"Diabetes Care","ISSN":"0149-5992, 1935-5548","date":"2004-06-01","DOI":"10.2337/diacare.27.6.1427","accessDate":"2018-10-02T05:37:28Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"OBJECTIVE — To investigate the association between serum ␥-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in Japanese male ofﬁce workers.

Subjects were divided into four GGT quartile groups according to their serum GGT level at baseline. The overall incidence of hypertension was 8.1%, and the incidence increased with increasing GGT quartile (3.8%, 6.9%, 9.0%, and 12.4% in the lowest, second, third, and highest GGT quartiles, respectively; P < .001). In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, lifestyle factors, glucose, uric acid, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds ratio (ORs) for incident hypertension increased with increasing GGT quartile (P for trend = .030).
