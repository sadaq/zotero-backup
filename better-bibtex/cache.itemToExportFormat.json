In Bangladesh, approximately 20% of adult and 40–65% of elderly people suffer from HTN. High incidence of metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle-related factors like obesity, high salt intake, and less physical activity may play important role in the pathophysiology of HTN. The association of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and low birth weight with blood pressure has been studied inadequately. Studies have found relationship between mass arsenic poisoning and HTN. Hypovitaminosis D presumably plays role in the aetiopathogenesis of HTN in Bangladeshi population. South Asians appear to respond to antihypertensive therapy in a similar manner to the Whites. The latest National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline advocates a calcium-channel blocker as step 1 antihypertensive treatment to people aged ≥ 55 years and an ACE inhibitor or a low-cost angiotensin-II receptor blocker for the younger people. Calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers have been found to be the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs in Bangladesh. Non-adherence to the standard guidelines and irrational drug prescribing are likely to be important. On the other hand, non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is quite high. At the advent of the new millennium, we are really unaware of our real situation. Large-scale, preferably, nation-wide survey and clinical research are needed to explore the different aspects of HTN in Bangladesh.","title":"Hypertension in Bangladesh: a review","shortTitle":"Hypertension in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"A.K.M.

Design: Longitudinal study. Setting: The study was carried out in icddr,b surveillance sites at rural Matlab in Chandpur district and semi-urban Kamalapur in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants: Randomly selected men and non-pregnant women aged 20 years or older without any acute illness or history of any vascular events such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction. Main outcome measure: Hypertension was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or as self-reported hypertension under medication. We advised patients to seek care from a qualified provider and to adopt a healthy lifestyle. We compared changes in BP from baseline to follow-up at around 6 months.\nResults: Overall, 17.1% (n=287) of participants had hypertension at baseline with significantly higher prevalence in the semi-urban than in the rural population (23.6% vs 10.8%; p<0.001); half were unaware of their condition. At follow-up, 83% (n=204) reported a visit to any healthcare provider. In the semi-urban area, a higher proportion of patients visited medically qualified practitioners than in the rural area (76.7% vs 36.6%, p<0.000). SBP (−3.3±20.7 mm Hg; p<0.01) and DBP (−2.0±13.0 mm Hg; p<0.02) were lower at follow-up. Those who visited medically qualified practitioners had significant SBP (−3.9±22.4 mm Hg; p<0.03) and DBP (−2.7±14.1 mm Hg; p<0.02) reduction. BP reduction did not reach statistical significance among those visiting a pharmacist or their village doctors. Overall, half of the patients with hypertension achieved the BP control goal (BP<140/90 mm Hg).\nConclusions: Awareness and simple health messages increase provider visit, reduce blood pressure and improve BP control in hypertensive Bangladeshis. Longer-term follow-up is required to verify the sustainability.","title":"Awareness and control of hypertension in Bangladesh: follow-up of a hypertensive cohort","shortTitle":"Awareness and control of hypertension in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"Dewan Shamsul","lastName":"Alam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad Ashique Haider","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ali Tanweer","lastName":"Siddiquee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shyfuddin","lastName":"Ahmed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Louis Wilhelmus","lastName":"Niessen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T04:01:10Z","dateModified":"2018-09-24T11:18:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/JI3CX2TA","itemID":287,"key":"JI3CX2TA"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882621926,"version":0},"$loki":12},{"itemID":283,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2261/16/22","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationTitle":"BMC Cardiovascular Disorders","ISSN":"1471-2261","date":"2016","DOI":"10.1186/s12872-016-0197-3","accessDate":"2018-08-31T03:58:30Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background: Hypertension is an increasing problem in Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh. Although some epidemiological studies on hypertension have been conducted in Bangladesh, the factors associated with hypertension in this nation remain unclear. We aimed to determine the factors associated with hypertension among the adults in Bangladesh.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the nationally representative 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). A total of 7,839 (3,964 women and 3,875 men) adults aged 35 years and older who participated in the survey was included. Hypertension was defined by a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and/or, receipt of an anti-hypertensive medication at time of the survey. The degree of association between the risk factors and the outcome was assessed by the odd ratio (OR) obtained from the bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models.\nResults: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 26.4 %, and the prevalence was higher in women (32.4 %) than men (20.3 %). Study participants with the age group of 60–69 years had higher odds of having hypertension (AOR: 3.77, 95 % CI: 3.01–4.72) than the age group 35–39 years. Moreover, individuals who had higher educational attainment (AOR: 1.63, 95 % C.I: 1.25–2.14) and higher wealth status (AOR = 1.91, 95 % CI: 1.54–2.38) had higher odds of having hypertension than the individuals with no education and lower social status, respectively. The analysis also showed that high BMI (AOR: 2.19, 95 % C.I: 1.87–2.57) and having diabetes (AOR: 1.54, 95 % C.I: 1.31–1.83) were associated with the increasing risk of hypertension.\nConclusions: Our study shows that the risk of hypertension was significantly associated with older age, sex, education, place of residence, working status, wealth index, BMI, and diabetes. Moreover, hypertension is largely untreated, especially in rural settings. The health system needs to develop appropriate strategies including early diagnosis, awareness via mass media, and health education programs for changing lifestyles should be initiated for older age, wealthy, and/or higher educated individuals in Bangladesh. Moreover, area-specific longitudinal research is necessary to find out the underlying causes of regional variations.","title":"Hypertension among adults in Bangladesh: evidence from a national cross-sectional survey","shortTitle":"Hypertension among adults in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"Muhammad Abdul Baker","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Md.

The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake.

However, only one-third of the normotensive subjects were reported to show salt-sensitivity in their blood pressure. Many factors have been proposed as causes of salt-sensitive hypertension, but none of them provides a satisfactory explanation. We propose, on the basis of accumulated data, that the reduced activity of the kallikrein-kinin system in the kidney may provide this link. Renal kallikrein is secreted by the distal connecting tubular cells and all kallikrein-kinin system components are distributed along the collecting ducts in the distal nephron. Bradykinin generated is immediately destroyed by carboxypeptidase Y-like exopeptidase and neutral endopeptidase, both quite independent from the kininases in plasma, such as angiotensin converting enzyme. The salt-sensitivity of the blood pressure depends largely upon ethnicity and potassium intake. Interestingly, potassium and ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel blockers accelerate renal kallikrein secretion and suppress blood pressure rises in animal hypertension models. Measurement of urinary kallikrein may become necessary in salt-sensitive normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Furthermore, pharmaceutical development of renal kallikrein releasers, such as KATP channel blockers, and renal kininase inhibitors, such as ebelactone B, may lead to the development of novel antihypertensive drugs.","title":"A Missing Link Between a High Salt Intake and Blood Pressure Increase","creators":[{"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Katori","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Majima","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-01T08:01:47Z","dateModified":"2018-09-01T08:01:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/BA9759RH","itemID":345,"key":"BA9759RH"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622084,"version":0},"$loki":29},{"itemID":201,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1751-7141.2009.00054.x","volume":"13","issue":"1","pages":"36-41","publicationTitle":"Preventive Cardiology","ISSN":"1520037X, 17517141","date":"2010","DOI":"10.1111/j.1751-7141.2009.00054.x","accessDate":"2018-08-20T12:58:35Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase: A Novel Cardiovascular Risk BioMarker: PREVENTIVE CARDIOLOGY","shortTitle":"Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase","creators":[{"firstName":"Jennifer E.","lastName":"Mason","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rodman D.","lastName":"Starke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"John E.","lastName":"Van Kirk","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T12:58:35Z","dateModified":"2018-10-02T05:52:10Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/BCRXNCQ5","itemID":201,"key":"BCRXNCQ5"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622272,"version":0},"$loki":34},{"itemID":314,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"webpage","url":"http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/EC2/3/2/2.html","date":"2011","accessDate":"2018-08-31T08:57:22Z","websiteTitle":"IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature","title":"EC 2.3.2.2","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"EC 2.3.2.2","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"GGT EC number"}],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T08:57:22Z","dateModified":"2018-09-04T08:26:14Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/KHJ8MBDN","itemID":314,"key":"KHJ8MBDN"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622282,"version":0},"$loki":35},{"itemID":356,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"38","issue":"4","pages":"93","publicationTitle":"Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences","date":"2001","DOI":"10.1080/20014091084227","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) has been widely used as an index of liver dysfunction and marker of alcohol intake.

Among the liver enzymes, important advances have especially been made in understanding the physiological functions of GGT. The primary role of GGT is the extracellular catabolism of glutathione, the major thiol antioxidant in mammalian cells, which plays a relevant role in protecting cells against oxidants produced during normal metabolism; GGT, therefore, plays an important role in cellular defence. Beyond its physiological functions, circulating serum GGT has been linked to a remarkable array of chronic conditions and diseases, which include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, vascular and nonvascular diseases and mortality outcomes. This review summarizes the available epidemiological and genetic evidence for the associations between GGT and these adverse outcomes, the postulated biologic mechanisms underlying these associations, outlines areas of outstanding uncertainty and the implications for clinical practice.","title":"Gamma-glutamyltransferase-friend or foe within?","creators":[{"firstName":"Setor K.","lastName":"Kunutsor","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-03T05:42:45Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:17:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/ZJLAYVIR","itemID":364,"key":"ZJLAYVIR"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622312,"version":0},"$loki":40},{"itemID":313,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10408368009108725","volume":"12","issue":"1","pages":"1-58","publicationTitle":"CRC Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences","ISSN":"0590-8191","date":"1980","DOI":"10.3109/10408368009108725","accessDate":"2018-08-31T08:52:32Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Structural, Functional, and Clinical Aspects of γ-Glutamyltransferase","creators":[{"firstName":"David M.","lastName":"Goldberg","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"GGT information"}],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T08:52:32Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:14:39Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/GEDYAG2S","itemID":313,"key":"GEDYAG2S"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1538882622316,"version":0},"$loki":41},{"itemID":216,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/10641963.2012.665539","volume":"34","issue":"6","pages":"402-409","publicationTitle":"Clinical and Experimental Hypertension","ISSN":"1064-1963, 1525-6006","date":"2012","DOI":"10.3109/10641963.2012.665539","accessDate":"2018-08-20T12:59:50Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) level within the normal range and incident hypertension according to drinking and obesity status in nonhypertensive individuals. We followed up 4783 normotensive adults (mean age = 44 years) who had serum GGT levels within the normal range at baseline for 3 years. Subjects were divided into four GGT quartile groups according to their serum GGT level at baseline. The overall incidence of hypertension was 8.1%, and the incidence increased with increasing GGT quartile (3.8%, 6.9%, 9.0%, and 12.4% in the lowest, second, third, and highest GGT quartiles, respectively; P < .001). In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, lifestyle factors, glucose, uric acid, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds ratio (ORs) for incident hypertension increased with increasing GGT quartile (P for trend = .030). In the above model, the highest quartile group showed increased ORs compared with those in the lowest quartile group (ORs [95% conﬁdence interval], 2.638 [1.259–5.528]). Subgroup analyses revealed a signiﬁcant association between GGT quartile and the incidence of hypertension in the drinker and nonoverweight groups. Our results indicate that elevated serum GGT levels within the normal range are associated with a higher risk of incident hypertension in Korean adults, particularly, in drinkers and non-overweight individuals, suggesting possible different pathophysiologic mechanisms in the incidence of alcohol- and obesity-related hypertension.","title":"Serum Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase Level Is an Independent

Main measurements included baseline and follow-up weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol), gamma-glutamyl transferase, urinary albumin creatinine ratio, self-reported tobacco smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity.\nResults: Hundred cases of hypertension developed over 2633.4 person-years giving a crude incidence of hypertension of 22.6 (16.2–31.4) per 1000 person-years in females and 60.0 (47.1–76.6) per 1000 person-years for males. Age standardized overall incidence was 51.9 per 1000 person-years. Aboriginal participants were twice as likely as Torres Strait Islanders to develop hypertension, which increased with age. Obesity (BMI >30) strongly predicted incident hypertension independently of age or sex (adjusted hazard ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.9–4.8). Albuminuria and elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase increased the risk of hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio 1.4–1.7) in this population.\nConclusion: Incidence of hypertension in indigenous Australian adults is nearly double than that of the general Australian population. High background prevalence of obesity, diabetes and albuminuria contributes to this excess. As well as early detection and management of high blood pressure, albuminuria and diabetes in primary care settings, attention should be equally focused on community-level prevention and management of obesity.","title":"Obesity, albuminuria, and gamma-glutamyl transferase predict incidence of hypertension in indigenous Australians in rural and remote communities in northern
