Design: Longitudinal study. Setting: The study was carried out in icddr,b surveillance sites at rural Matlab in Chandpur district and semi-urban Kamalapur in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants: Randomly selected men and non-pregnant women aged 20 years or older without any acute illness or history of any vascular events such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction. Main outcome measure: Hypertension was defined as systolic BP (SBP) ≥140 and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg or as self-reported hypertension under medication. We advised patients to seek care from a qualified provider and to adopt a healthy lifestyle. We compared changes in BP from baseline to follow-up at around 6 months.\nResults: Overall, 17.1% (n=287) of participants had hypertension at baseline with significantly higher prevalence in the semi-urban than in the rural population (23.6% vs 10.8%; p<0.001); half were unaware of their condition. At follow-up, 83% (n=204) reported a visit to any healthcare provider. In the semi-urban area, a higher proportion of patients visited medically qualified practitioners than in the rural area (76.7% vs 36.6%, p<0.000). SBP (−3.3±20.7 mm Hg; p<0.01) and DBP (−2.0±13.0 mm Hg; p<0.02) were lower at follow-up. Those who visited medically qualified practitioners had significant SBP (−3.9±22.4 mm Hg; p<0.03) and DBP (−2.7±14.1 mm Hg; p<0.02) reduction. BP reduction did not reach statistical significance among those visiting a pharmacist or their village doctors. Overall, half of the patients with hypertension achieved the BP control goal (BP<140/90 mm Hg).\nConclusions: Awareness and simple health messages increase provider visit, reduce blood pressure and improve BP control in hypertensive Bangladeshis. Longer-term follow-up is required to verify the sustainability.","title":"Awareness and control of hypertension in Bangladesh: follow-up of a hypertensive cohort","shortTitle":"Awareness and control of hypertension in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"Dewan Shamsul","lastName":"Alam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Muhammad Ashique Haider","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ali Tanweer","lastName":"Siddiquee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shyfuddin","lastName":"Ahmed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Louis Wilhelmus","lastName":"Niessen","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T04:01:10Z","dateModified":"2018-09-24T11:18:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/JI3CX2TA","itemID":287,"key":"JI3CX2TA","citekey":"alamAwarenessControlHypertension2014","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614175508,"version":0},"$loki":1},{"itemID":283,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2261/16/22","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationTitle":"BMC Cardiovascular Disorders","ISSN":"1471-2261","date":"2016","DOI":"10.1186/s12872-016-0197-3","accessDate":"2018-08-31T03:58:30Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background: Hypertension is an increasing problem in Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh. Although some epidemiological studies on hypertension have been conducted in Bangladesh, the factors associated with hypertension in this nation remain unclear. We aimed to determine the factors associated with hypertension among the adults in Bangladesh.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the nationally representative 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). A total of 7,839 (3,964 women and 3,875 men) adults aged 35 years and older who participated in the survey was included. Hypertension was defined by a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and/or, receipt of an anti-hypertensive medication at time of the survey. The degree of association between the risk factors and the outcome was assessed by the odd ratio (OR) obtained from the bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models.\nResults: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 26.4 %, and the prevalence was higher in women (32.4 %) than men (20.3 %). Study participants with the age group of 60–69 years had higher odds of having hypertension (AOR: 3.77, 95 % CI: 3.01–4.72) than the age group 35–39 years. Moreover, individuals who had higher educational attainment (AOR: 1.63, 95 % C.I: 1.25–2.14) and higher wealth status (AOR = 1.91, 95 % CI: 1.54–2.38) had higher odds of having hypertension than the individuals with no education and lower social status, respectively. The analysis also showed that high BMI (AOR: 2.19, 95 % C.I: 1.87–2.57) and having diabetes (AOR: 1.54, 95 % C.I: 1.31–1.83) were associated with the increasing risk of hypertension.\nConclusions: Our study shows that the risk of hypertension was significantly associated with older age, sex, education, place of residence, working status, wealth index, BMI, and diabetes. Moreover, hypertension is largely untreated, especially in rural settings. The health system needs to develop appropriate strategies including early diagnosis, awareness via mass media, and health education programs for changing lifestyles should be initiated for older age, wealthy, and/or higher educated individuals in Bangladesh. Moreover, area-specific longitudinal research is necessary to find out the underlying causes of regional variations.","title":"Hypertension among adults in Bangladesh: evidence from a national cross-sectional survey","shortTitle":"Hypertension among adults in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"Muhammad Abdul Baker","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Md.

It also showed that over the period 1986Á2006, age-standardized mortality rate (for both sexes) due to diarrhea and dysentery reduced by 86%, respiratory infections by 79%, except for tuberculosis which increased by 173%. On the other hand, during the same period, mortality due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases increased by a massive 3,527% and malignant neoplasms by 495%, whereas mortality due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and injury remained in the similar level (12Á13% increase).\nConclusion: The trend of selected causes of death demonstrates that in next two decades, deaths due to communicable diseases will decline substantially and the mortality due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) will increase at massive proportions. Despite Matlab’s significant advances in socio-demographic indicators, emergence of NCDs and mortality associated with it would be the major cause for concern in the coming years.","title":"Epidemiological transition in rural Bangladesh, 1986–2006","creators":[{"firstName":"Zunaid Ahsan","lastName":"Karar","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Nurul","lastName":"Alam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kim Streatfield","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/7TAMJ4FC"]},"dateAdded":"2018-08-31T04:02:55Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:16:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/DZ2KS58E","itemID":289,"key":"DZ2KS58E","citekey":"kararEpidemiologicalTransitionRural2009","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614175574,"version":0},"$loki":4},{"itemID":518,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0917504016300442","volume":"27","issue":"1","pages":"8-13","publicationTitle":"Journal of Epidemiology","ISSN":"09175040","date":"01/2017","DOI":"10.1016/j.je.2016.08.001","accessDate":"2018-10-24T06:08:33Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background: Subjects with prehypertension (pre-HT; 120/80 to 139/89 mm Hg) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, whether the risk of pre-HT can be seen at the pre-HT status or only after progression to a hypertensive (HT; \u0015140/90 mm Hg) state during the follow-up period is unknown.\nMethods: The Jichi Medical Cohort study enrolled 12,490 subjects recruited from a Japanese general population. Of those, 2227 subjects whose BP data at baseline and at the middle of follow-up and tracking of CVD events were available (median follow-up period: 11.8 years). We evaluated the risk of HT in those with normal BP or pre-HT at baseline whose BP progressed to HT at the middle of follow-up compared with those whose BP remained at normal or pre-HT levels.\nResults: Among the 707 normotensive patients at baseline, 34.1% and 6.6% of subjects progressed to preHT and HT, respectively, by the middle of follow-up. Among 702 subjects with pre-HT at baseline, 26.1% progressed to HT. During the follow-up period, there were 11 CVD events in normotensive patients and 16 CVD events in pre-HT patients at baseline. The subjects who progressed from pre-HT to HT had 2.95 times higher risk of CVD than those who remained at normal BP or pre-HT in a multivariable-adjusted Cox hazard model.\nConclusion: This relatively long-term prospective cohort study indicated that the CVD risk with pre-HT might increase after progression to HT; however, the number of CVD events was small. Therefore, the results need to be conﬁrmed in a larger cohort.","title":"Progression from prehypertension to hypertension and risk of cardiovascular disease","creators":[{"firstName":"Yukiko","lastName":"Ishikawa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Joji","lastName":"Ishikawa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shizukiyo","lastName":"Ishikawa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kazuomi","lastName":"Kario","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Kajii","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-24T06:09:03Z","dateModified":"2018-10-24T06:09:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/6QDY2CJT","itemID":518,"key":"6QDY2CJT","citekey":"ishikawaProgressionPrehypertensionHypertension2017","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614175584,"version":0},"$loki":5},{"itemID":356,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"38","issue":"4","pages":"93","publicationTitle":"Critical Reviews in Clinical Laboratory Sciences","date":"2001","DOI":"10.1080/20014091084227","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","language":"en","abstractNote":"Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) has been widely used as an index of liver dysfunction and marker of alcohol intake.

In Bangladesh, approximately 20% of adult and 40–65% of elderly people suffer from HTN. High incidence of metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle-related factors like obesity, high salt intake, and less physical activity may play important role in the pathophysiology of HTN. The association of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and low birth weight with blood pressure has been studied inadequately. Studies have found relationship between mass arsenic poisoning and HTN. Hypovitaminosis D presumably plays role in the aetiopathogenesis of HTN in Bangladeshi population. South Asians appear to respond to antihypertensive therapy in a similar manner to the Whites. The latest National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline advocates a calcium-channel blocker as step 1 antihypertensive treatment to people aged ≥ 55 years and an ACE inhibitor or a low-cost angiotensin-II receptor blocker for the younger people. Calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers have been found to be the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs in Bangladesh. Non-adherence to the standard guidelines and irrational drug prescribing are likely to be important. On the other hand, non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is quite high. At the advent of the new millennium, we are really unaware of our real situation. Large-scale, preferably, nation-wide survey and clinical research are needed to explore the different aspects of HTN in Bangladesh.","title":"Hypertension in Bangladesh: a review","shortTitle":"Hypertension in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"A.K.M.

The key messages of this report are: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of >140 mmHg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP (DBP); beginning at 115/75 mmHg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mmHg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90 percent lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 80–89 mmHg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions, which are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP (<140/90 mmHg, or <130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease); for patients whose BP is >20 mmHg above the SBP goal or 10 mmHg above the DBP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will only be controlled if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.","title":"The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"National High Blood Pressure Education Program","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Hypertension classification"}],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-29T05:00:45Z","dateModified":"2018-09-03T04:33:16Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/HYI87RYY","itemID":244,"key":"HYI87RYY","citekey":"nationalhighbloodpressureeducationprogramSeventhReportJoint2004","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825734,"version":0},"$loki":26},{"itemID":326,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"webpage","url":"https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings","date":"2018","accessDate":"2018-08-31T11:21:51Z","language":"en","abstractNote":"Use our blood pressure chart to learn what your blood pressure numbers mean.

The complex pathological processes reflect environmental and genetic interactions, and individuals from disadvantaged communities seem to have greater risks than more affluent individuals partly because of fetal and postnatal imprinting. Obesity, with its array of comorbidities, necessitates careful clinical assessment to identify underlying factors and to allow coherent management. The epidemic reflects progressive secular and age-related decreases in physical activity, together with substantial dietary changes with passive over-consumption of energy despite the neurobiological processes controlling food intake. Effective long-term weight loss depends on permanent changes in dietary quality, energy intake, and activity.

However, only one-third of the normotensive subjects were reported to show salt-sensitivity in their blood pressure. Many factors have been proposed as causes of salt-sensitive hypertension, but none of them provides a satisfactory explanation. We propose, on the basis of accumulated data, that the reduced activity of the kallikrein-kinin system in the kidney may provide this link. Renal kallikrein is secreted by the distal connecting tubular cells and all kallikrein-kinin system components are distributed along the collecting ducts in the distal nephron. Bradykinin generated is immediately destroyed by carboxypeptidase Y-like exopeptidase and neutral endopeptidase, both quite independent from the kininases in plasma, such as angiotensin converting enzyme. The salt-sensitivity of the blood pressure depends largely upon ethnicity and potassium intake. Interestingly, potassium and ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel blockers accelerate renal kallikrein secretion and suppress blood pressure rises in animal hypertension models. Measurement of urinary kallikrein may become necessary in salt-sensitive normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Furthermore, pharmaceutical development of renal kallikrein releasers, such as KATP channel blockers, and renal kininase inhibitors, such as ebelactone B, may lead to the development of novel antihypertensive drugs.","title":"A Missing Link Between a High Salt Intake and Blood Pressure Increase","creators":[{"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Katori","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Masataka","lastName":"Majima","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-01T08:01:47Z","dateModified":"2018-09-01T08:01:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/BA9759RH","itemID":345,"key":"BA9759RH","citekey":"katoriMissingLinkHigh2006","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825780,"version":0},"$loki":33},{"itemID":346,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"webpage","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/prevention/","date":"2017","accessDate":"2018-09-01T08:05:11Z","language":"en","abstractNote":"Find out about the lifestyle changes you can make to prevent and reduce high blood pressure.","websiteTitle":"nhs.uk","title":"Prevention","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"nhs","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-01T08:05:11Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T05:18:46Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/BXUSWT9L","itemID":346,"key":"BXUSWT9L","citekey":"nhsPrevention2017","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825784,"version":0},"$loki":34},{"itemID":323,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172631","volume":"12","issue":"2","pages":"e0172631","publicationTitle":"PLOS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","date":"2017","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0172631","accessDate":"2018-08-31T10:45:23Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation likely contributes to cardiovascular (CV) mortality, however it has remained unknown whether a dose-response relationship exists between serum GGT and CV mortality.\nMethods We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases for prospective cohort studies published up to October 2, 2016. Summary hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed effects model. Findings Nine prospective studies, including 527,589 participants and more than 7,011 cases, were included in this meta-analysis. For the moderate, high, and highest levels of GGT, the pooled HRs of CV mortality were 1.11 (95% CI = 1.04–1.19), 1.29 (95% CI = 1.21–1.38) and 1.59 (95% CI = 1.47–1.72), respectively (all p < 0.05 as compared to the lowest levels of GGT). Additionally, the HR per incremental increase of GGT by 10 U/L was 1.10 (95% CI = 1.08–1.11). Evidence of a positive relationship with nonlinear trend for GGT elevation with CV mortality in females was found (P = 0.04 for nonlinearity). However, a linear model was better fit to illustrate the GGT-CV mortality among males (P = 0.304 for nonlinearity).\nConclusions These findings indicate that serum GGT activity within the reference interval is positively associated with increased risk of CV mortality in a dose-response manner.","title":"Gamma-glutamyltransferase and risk of cardiovascular mortality: A dose-response meta-analysis

(GGT) is a liver enzyme, which is located on the plasma membranes of most cells and organ tissues, but more commonly in hepatocytes, and is routinely used in clinical practice to help indicate liver injury and as a marker of excessive alcohol consumption. Among the liver enzymes, important advances have especially been made in understanding the physiological functions of GGT. The primary role of GGT is the extracellular catabolism of glutathione, the major thiol antioxidant in mammalian cells, which plays a relevant role in protecting cells against oxidants produced during normal metabolism; GGT, therefore, plays an important role in cellular defence. Beyond its physiological functions, circulating serum GGT has been linked to a remarkable array of chronic conditions and diseases, which include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, vascular and nonvascular diseases and mortality outcomes. This review summarizes the available epidemiological and genetic evidence for the associations between GGT and these adverse outcomes, the postulated biologic mechanisms underlying these associations, outlines areas of outstanding uncertainty and the implications for clinical practice.","title":"Gamma-glutamyltransferase-friend or foe within?","creators":[{"firstName":"Setor

investigate the association between serum ␥-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in Japanese male ofﬁce workers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This study included 2,957 metabolic syndrome–free men and 3,260 nondiabetic men aged 35–59 years who did not have medication for hepatitis, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels higher than three times the upper limit of the reference range, or a history of cardiovascular disease at study entry. Subjects were reexamined at periodic annual health examinations over a 7-year period. We used a modiﬁed National Cholesterol Education Program deﬁnition of metabolic syndrome with BMI instead of waist circumference and the revised criteria of the American Diabetes Association for type 2 diabetes.\nRESULTS — With adjustment for age, family history of diabetes, BMI, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, regular physical activity (fasting plasma glucose for the risk of type 2 diabetes), and white blood cell (WBC) count, the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes increased in correlation with the levels of serum GGT, ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase. Additional adjustment for all of the other liver enzymes attenuated these associations, but serum GGT remained a signiﬁcant risk factor for the risk of both metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (P for trend Ͻ0.001 for both). Top one-ﬁfth versus bottom one-ﬁfth relative risks of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes were 2.23 (95% CI 1.51–3.30) and 2.44 (1.34 – 4.46), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS — These results indicate that serum GGT may be an important predictor for developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in middle-aged Japanese men.","title":"Serum -Glutamyltransferase and Risk of Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes in Middle-Aged Japanese Men","creators":[{"firstName":"N.","lastName":"Nakanishi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"K.","lastName":"Suzuki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"K.","lastName":"Tatara","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-02T05:37:28Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T05:16:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/LURPTLQX","itemID":450,"key":"LURPTLQX","citekey":"nakanishiSerumGlutamyltransferaseRisk2004","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825896,"version":0},"$loki":54},{"itemID":452,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.ATV.0000251993.20372.40","volume":"27","issue":"1","pages":"127-133","publicationTitle":"Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology","ISSN":"1079-5642, 1524-4636","date":"2007","DOI":"10.1161/01.ATV.0000251993.20372.40","accessDate":"2018-10-02T05:42:52Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Objective—To determine whether serum ␥-glutamyl transferase (GGT) predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, accounting for temporal changes in known CVD risk factors and C-reactive protein (CRP).\nMethods and Results—In 3451 Framingham Study participants (mean age 44 years, 52% women) we examined the relations of GGT with CVD risk factors, and prospectively determined the risk of new-onset metabolic syndrome, incident CVD, and death.

We followed up 4783 normotensive adults (mean age = 44 years) who had serum GGT levels within the normal range at baseline for 3 years. Subjects were divided into four GGT quartile groups according to their serum GGT level at baseline. The overall incidence of hypertension was 8.1%, and the incidence increased with increasing GGT quartile (3.8%, 6.9%, 9.0%, and 12.4% in the lowest, second, third, and highest GGT quartiles, respectively; P < .001). In the logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, lifestyle factors, glucose, uric acid, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds ratio (ORs) for incident hypertension increased with increasing GGT quartile (P for trend = .030). In the above model, the highest quartile group showed increased ORs compared with those in the lowest quartile group (ORs [95% conﬁdence interval], 2.638 [1.259–5.528]). Subgroup analyses revealed a signiﬁcant association between GGT quartile and the incidence of hypertension in the drinker and nonoverweight groups. Our results indicate that elevated serum GGT levels within the normal range are associated with a higher risk of incident hypertension in Korean adults, particularly, in drinkers and non-overweight individuals, suggesting possible different pathophysiologic mechanisms in the incidence of alcohol- and obesity-related hypertension.","title":"Serum Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase Level Is an Independent Predictor of Incident Hypertension in Korean Adults","creators":[{"firstName":"Nan Hee","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jung Kwon","lastName":"Huh","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Byung Jin","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Min Woong","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bum Soo","lastName":"Kim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jin Ho","lastName":"Kang","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T12:59:50Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:16:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/EK7RPFGZ","itemID":216,"key":"EK7RPFGZ","citekey":"kimSerumGammaGlutamylTransferase2012","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825934,"version":0},"$loki":57},{"itemID":242,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"20","issue":"4","pages":"842-848","publicationTitle":"Obesity","date":"2012","extra":"Citation Key: onat2012serum \nbibtex[publisher=Wiley Online Library]","title":"Serum γ-glutamyltransferase: independent predictor of risk of diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and coronary disease","creators":[{"firstName":"Altan","lastName":"Onat","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Günay","lastName":"Can","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ender","lastName":"Örnek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gökhan","lastName":"¸Ciçek","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erkan","lastName":"Ayhan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yüksel","lastName":"Dŏgan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T13:23:50Z","dateModified":"2018-08-20T13:23:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/SBGSJVQ3","itemID":242,"key":"SBGSJVQ3","citekey":"onat2012serum","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825938,"version":0},"$loki":58},{"itemID":206,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&an=00005792-201512150-00021","volume":"94","issue":"50","pages":"e2171","publicationTitle":"Medicine","ISSN":"0025-7974","date":"2015","DOI":"10.1097/MD.0000000000002171","accessDate":"2018-08-20T12:59:00Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Previous studies suggested that serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were associated with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the general population.

describe the incidence of hypertension in a cohort of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\nMethod: A follow-up study conducted among 1831 indigenous population aged 15 years and over without hypertension at baseline from 19 communities in North Queensland during 1997–2008. Main measurements included baseline and follow-up weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol), gamma-glutamyl transferase, urinary albumin creatinine ratio, self-reported tobacco smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity.\nResults: Hundred cases of hypertension developed over 2633.4 person-years giving a crude incidence of hypertension of 22.6 (16.2–31.4) per 1000 person-years in females and 60.0 (47.1–76.6) per 1000 person-years for males. Age standardized overall incidence was 51.9 per 1000 person-years. Aboriginal participants were twice as likely as Torres Strait Islanders to develop hypertension, which increased with age. Obesity (BMI >30) strongly predicted incident hypertension independently of age or sex (adjusted hazard ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.9–4.8). Albuminuria and elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase increased the risk of hypertension (adjusted hazard ratio 1.4–1.7) in this population.\nConclusion: Incidence of hypertension in indigenous Australian adults is nearly double than that of the general Australian population. High background prevalence of obesity, diabetes and albuminuria contributes to this excess. As well as early detection and management of high blood pressure, albuminuria and diabetes in primary care settings, attention should be equally focused on community-level prevention and management of obesity.","title":"Obesity, albuminuria, and gamma-glutamyl transferase predict incidence of hypertension in indigenous Australians in rural and remote communities in northern Australia:","shortTitle":"Obesity, albuminuria, and gamma-glutamyl transferase predict incidence of hypertension in indigenous Australians in rural and remote communities in northern Australia","creators":[{"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Robyn","lastName":"McDermott","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T12:58:55Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T05:15:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/V492Y7UX","itemID":205,"key":"V492Y7UX","citekey":"liObesityAlbuminuriaGammaglutamyl2015","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825990,"version":0},"$loki":65},{"itemID":495,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"53","issue":"3","pages":"312-332","publicationTitle":"Annals of clinical biochemistry","date":"2016","extra":"Citation Key: bulusu2016does \nbibtex[publisher=SAGE Publications Sage UK: London, England]","title":"What does serum γ-glutamyltransferase tell us as a cardiometabolic risk marker?","creators":[{"firstName":"Sudha","lastName":"Bulusu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Manisha","lastName":"Sharma","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-16T02:57:51Z","dateModified":"2018-10-16T02:57:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/9MRTX8AT","itemID":495,"key":"9MRTX8AT","citekey":"bulusu2016does","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614825994,"version":0},"$loki":66},{"itemID":443,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/dm/2015/818570/","volume":"2015","pages":"1-18","publicationTitle":"Disease Markers","ISSN":"0278-0240, 1875-8630","date":"2015","DOI":"10.1155/2015/818570","accessDate":"2018-09-28T07:11:03Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Gamma-Glutamyltransferase: A Predictive Biomarker of Cellular Antioxidant Inadequacy and Disease Risk","shortTitle":"Gamma-Glutamyltransferase","creators":[{"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Koenig","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stephanie","lastName":"Seneff","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-28T07:11:03Z","dateModified":"2018-09-28T07:11:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/TV7J9PH9","itemID":443,"key":"TV7J9PH9","citekey":"koenigGammaGlutamyltransferasePredictiveBiomarker2015","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614826000,"version":0},"$loki":67},{"itemID":472,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021915004004605","volume":"178","issue":"2","pages":"327-330","publicationTitle":"Atherosclerosis","ISSN":"00219150","date":"2005","DOI":"10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2004.08.027","accessDate":"2018-10-07T05:41:09Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"A series of epidemiological studies have suggested serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) within its normal range might be an early marker of oxidative stress.

located on the external surface of cellular membranes. GGT contributes in maintaining the physiological concentrations of cytoplasmic glutathione and cellular defense against oxidative stress via cleavage of extracellular glutathione and increased availability of amino acids for its intracellular synthesis. Increased GGT activity is a marker of antioxidant inadequacy and increased oxidative stress. Ample evidence suggests that elevated GGT activity is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, arterial hypertension, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause and CVD-related mortality. The evidence is weaker for an association between elevated GGT activity and acute ischemic events and myocardial infarction. The risk for CVD or CVD-related mortality mediated by GGT may be explained by the close correlation of GGT with conventional CVD risk factors and various comorbidities, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption, oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and systemic inflammation. The finding of GGT activity in atherosclerotic plaques and correlation of intra-plaque GGT activity with histological indexes of plaque instability may suggest a participation of GGT in the pathophysiology of CVD, particularly atherosclerosis. However, whether GGT has a direct role in the pathophysiology of CVD or it is an epiphenomenon of coexisting CVD risk factors or comorbidities remains unknown and Hill’s criteria of causality relationship between GGT and CVD are not fulfilled. The exploration whether GGT provides prognostic information on top of the information provided by known cardiovascular risk factors regarding the CVD or CVD-related outcome and exploration of molecular mechanisms of GGT involvement in the pathophysiology of CVD and eventual use of interventions to reduce circulating GGT activity remain a duty of future studies.","title":"Gamma-glutamyl transferase and cardiovascular disease","creators":[{"firstName":"Gjin","lastName":"Ndrepepa","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Adnan","lastName":"Kastrati","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T12:58:20Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T05:16:19Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/R96GMI8K","itemID":198,"key":"R96GMI8K","citekey":"ndrepepaGammaglutamylTransferaseCardiovascular2016","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614826074,"version":0},"$loki":79},{"itemID":526,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"27","issue":"18","pages":"2170-2176","publicationTitle":"European Heart Journal","date":"2006","extra":"Citation Key: lee2006serum \nbibtex[publisher=Oxford University Press]","title":"Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase predicts non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease among 28 838 middle-aged men and women","creators":[{"firstName":"Duk-Hee","lastName":"Lee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karri","lastName":"Silventoinen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Hu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"David R","lastName":"Jacobs Jr","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Jousilahti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jouko","lastName":"Sundvall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Tuomilehto","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-27T04:33:33Z","dateModified":"2018-10-27T04:33:33Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/2MFVIKHB","itemID":526,"key":"2MFVIKHB","citekey":"lee2006serum","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540614834696,"version":0},"$loki":80},{"itemID":401,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"18","issue":"1","pages":"58","publicationTitle":"BMC public health","date":"2017","extra":"Citation Key: ali2018hypertension \nbibtex[publisher=BioMed Central]","title":"Hypertension prevalence and influence of basal metabolic rate on blood pressure among adult students in Bangladesh","creators":[{"firstName":"Nurshad","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shakil","lastName":"Mahmood","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M","lastName":"Manirujjaman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Rasheda","lastName":"Perveen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Nahid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shamim","lastName":"Ahmed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Farida Adib","lastName":"Khanum","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mustafizur","lastName":"Rahman","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["DXJ6GFE8"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-09-17T06:03:51Z","dateModified":"2018-09-17T06:03:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/IMAMIEEK","itemID":401,"key":"IMAMIEEK","citekey":"ali2018hypertension","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540629748148,"version":0},"$loki":82},{"itemID":530,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.qscience.com/doi/10.5339/gcsp.2015.43","volume":"2015","issue":"4","pages":"43","publicationTitle":"Global Cardiology Science and Practice","ISSN":"2305-7823","date":"2015","DOI":"10.5339/gcsp.2015.43","accessDate":"2018-10-27T08:51:48Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background: Hypertension is a major risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The prevalence of hypertension is increasing in Bangladesh, especially in urban areas. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of hypertension and its risk factors in an urban area of Bangladesh.\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey involving participants aged $ 25 years in an urban area in Dhaka between June-December 2012, using multi-stage random sampling. Data on socioeconomic status, tobacco use, physical activity, diet, extra-salt use, family history of hypertension, CVD, anthropometric measurements and blood pressure were collected using modified WHO-STEPS protocol. Hypertension and pre-hypertension were defined according to JNC-7. Multiple logistic regressions models were used to identify risk factors associated with hypertension.\nResults: The overall age-adjusted prevalence hypertension and pre-hypertension among 730 participants was 23.7% and 19%, respectively, which was higher among males compared to females (23.6% vs 21.71% and 21.7% vs 17.0%, respectively). Bivariate analysis showed significant relationship of hypertension with age, BMI, no physical activity, tobacco use, extra salt intake and family history of stroke/cardiovascular disease. In the multivariate model, factors significantly associated with hypertension were older age (OR 19.18, 95% CI 13.58–28.11), smoking (OR 3.47, 95% CI 2.85 –5.19), extra salt intake (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–2.21), and high waist circumference (OR 3.41, 95% CI 2.81 –5.29).\nConclusions: The prevalence of hypertension and pre-hypertension was high among our study participants. Population-based intervention programs and policies for increased awareness about the risk factors, and life-style modification are essential for prevention of hypertension.","title":"Prevalence of risk factors for hypertension: A cross-sectional study in an urban area of Bangladesh","shortTitle":"Prevalence of risk factors for hypertension","creators":[{"firstName":"Shiekh Mohammed Shariful","lastName":"Islam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Akm","lastName":"Mainuddin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Md Serajul","lastName":"Islam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohammad Azizul","lastName":"Karim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sabrina Zaman","lastName":"Mou","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shamsul","lastName":"Arefin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kamrun Nahar","lastName":"Chowdhury","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-27T08:51:48Z","dateModified":"2018-10-27T08:51:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/BILYQP28","itemID":530,"key":"BILYQP28","citekey":"islamPrevalenceRiskFactors2015","libraryID":1},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540630336432,"version":0},"$loki":83},{"itemID":285,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1520-0","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationTitle":"BMC Public Health","ISSN":"1471-2458","date":"2015","DOI":"10.1186/s12889-015-1520-0","accessDate":"2018-08-31T03:59:48Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background: The people of low and middle income countries bear about 80% of the global burden of diseases that are attributable to high blood pressure. Hypertensive people contribute half of this burden; the rest is among the people with lesser degrees of high blood pressure. Prehypertension elevates the risk of CVD, and that of end-stage renal disease. Bangladesh is a developing country, with more than 75% of the population live in rural area. This study aims to determine the prevalence and predictors of pre-hypertension and hypertension among the adults in rural Bangladesh.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study of major non-communicable disease risk factors (tobacco and alcohol use, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity) was conducted in rural surveillance sites of Bangladesh. In addition to the self-reported information on risk factors, height and weight, and blood pressure were measured during household visits using standard protocols of the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance. The study population included 6,094 men and women aged 25 years and above. Adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of prehypertension and hypertension with various factors.\nResults: The prevalence of pre-hypertension and hypertension was 31.9% and 16.0%, respectively. The men had a higher prevalence (33.6%) of pre-hypertension compared to the women (30.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that increasing age [OR 2.30 (1.84-2.87)] and higher BMI [OR 4.67 (3.35-6.51) were positively associated with pre-hypertension. For hypertension, multivariate analysis showed that increasing age [OR 4.48 (3.38-5.94)] and higher BMI (specially the overweight category) was positively associated. Significant linear relationships of prehypertension were found with age [P for trend < 0.0001] and BMI [P for trend < 0.0001]. Linear regression for hypertension shows significant association with age [P for trend < 0.0001] but not with BMI [P for trend 0.3783].\nConclusion: Approximately one third and one-sixth of the adult population of rural Bangladesh are affected with pre-hypertension and hypertension, respectively. This poses a great challenge ahead, as most of the people with pre-hypertension will progress towards hypertension until otherwise undergo in any pharmacological or lifestyle intervention.","title":"Prevalence and determinants of pre-hypertension and hypertension among the adults in rural Bangladesh: findings from a community-based study","shortTitle":"Prevalence and

Also, currently there is little data available on the association between serum GGT level and clinically relevant blood pressure (BP) categories earlier in the disease continuum, when hypertension prevention efforts may be applicable. The association between serum GGT and prehypertension was examined in a nationally representative sample of US adults.\nMethods and Results Cross-sectional study among 5,827 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2002 participants aged ≥18 years without cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension. The main outcome-of-interest was the presence of prehypertension (systolic BP 120–139 mmHg or diastolic BP 80–89 mmHg) (n=2,269). Higher serum GGT levels were positively associated with prehypertension, independent of smoking, waist circumference, diabetes, cholesterol levels and other confounders. The multivariable odds ratio (95% conﬁdence intervals) comparing quartile 4 of GGT (>29 U/L) to quartile 1 (<13 U/L) was 1.84 (1.37–2.46), p<0.0001. This association persisted in separate analyses among men and women. The results were consistent in subgroup analyses by race-ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, waist circumference and diabetes. In non-parametric models, the positive association between serum GGT and prehypertension appeared to be present across the full range of GGT, without any threshold effect.\nConclusions Higher serum GGT levels are associated with prehypertension in a nationally representative sample of US adults, free of CVD and hypertension.

The FLI is calculated from BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and the hepatic insulin resistance index from endogenous glucose production and fasting insulin.\nResults: The incidence of hypertension increased across the quartiles groups of both baseline GGT and alanine aminotransferase. After adjustment for sex, age, waist circumference, fasting glucose, smoking and alcohol intake, only GGT was significantly related with incident hypertension [standardized odds ratio: 1.21; 95% confidence interval (1.10–1.34); P ¼ 0.0001]. The change in GGT levels over the follow-up was also related with an increased risk of hypertension, independently of changes in body weight. FLI analysed as a continuous value, or FLI at least 60 at baseline were predictive of incident hypertension in the multivariable model. In the RISC cohort, the hepatic insulin resistance index was positively related with the risk of 3-year incident hypertension [standardized odds ratio: 1.54 (1.07–2.22); P ¼ 0.02].\nConclusion: Baseline GGT and FLI, as well as an increase in GGT over time, were associated with the risk of incident hypertension. Enhanced hepatic insulin resistance predicted the onset of hypertension and may be a link between liver markers and hypertension.","title":"Gamma-glutamyltransferase, fatty liver index and hepatic

demonstrated a positive association between serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels and blood pressure. Accordingly, we aimed to analyze serum GGT levels in patients with prehypertension and examine the relationship with aortic elasticity parameters. The study population consisted of 25 newly diagnosed prehypertensive individuals and 25 healthy control subjects. Aortic strain, distensibility index, and stiffness index beta were calculated from aortic diameters measured by echocardiography and blood pressures simultaneously measured by sphygmomanometry. Prehypertensive patients were detected to have significantly lower aortic distensibility and strain indexes compared to control subjects aortic distensibility. However, aortic stiffness index beta of the prehypertensive group was significantly higher compared to that of the control group (3.73 ± 1.41 vs. 2.97 ± 0.82, p = 0.02). The mean GGT levels were found to be higher in patients with prehypertension compared to those of controls (47.9 ± 15.9 U/L vs. 36.1 ± 9.4 U/L, p = 0.003). When multiple linear regression analysis was done to clarify the contributions of GGT to aortic elasticity adjusting for age, body mass index, uric acid, serum glucose, heart rate, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglyceride, we observed that only serum GGT levels were significantly associated with aortic elasticity parameters (for aortic strain beta = −0.247, p < 0.001; for aortic distensibility beta = −0.108, p < 0.001; for stiffness index beta = 0.063, p < 0.001). Whatever the mechanism is, young patients with prehypertension have higher serum GGT levels compared to healthy control subjects. More importantly, increased GGT levels are independently associated with impaired aortic elasticity in patients with prehypertension.","title":"The Relationship of Gamma-Glutamyltransferase to Aortic

activities of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are often increased in cardiometabolic diseases. We investigated if hypertension is associated with increased activities of these plasma markers.\nMethods: We included 235 hypertensive and 708 normotensive subjects (mean age 47.3 ± 9.6 and 58.0 ± 10.2 years respectively) from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study-2 (CRISPS-2) in 2000–2004 who had drank b 1/week. In the follow-up study in 2005–2008 (CRISPS-3), 126 out of the 708 subjects had developed hypertension.\nResults: Raised plasma ALT (OR = 1.22 per SD of log-transformed level, P = 0.045) and GGT (OR = 1.38 per SD of log-transformed level, P = 0.001) levels were associated with hypertension at baseline in CRISPS-2 after adjusting for covariates. Among subjects not on anti-hypertensive medications, plasma ALP, ALT and GGT were related to blood pressure (P b 0.01). In subjects normotensive at CRISPS-2, plasma GGT, but not ALP, ALT and AST, was an independent predictor of new-onset hypertension at CRISPS-3 (OR = 1.38 per SD of log-transformed level, P = 0.020 and OR = 2.68 for 3rd tertile vs. 1st tertile, P = 0.004) after adjusting for covariates.\nConclusions: Among the 4 plasma markers, increased GGT activity is the strongest predictor for existing and new-onset hypertension in Hong Kong Chinese.","title":"Gamma-glutamyl transferase level predicts the development of hypertension in Hong Kong Chinese","creators":[{"firstName":"Bernard M.Y.","lastName":"Cheung","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Kwok-Leung","lastName":"Ong","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Annette W.K.","lastName":"Tso","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Stacey S.","lastName":"Cherny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Pak-Chung","lastName":"Sham","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tai-Hing","lastName":"Lam","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karen S.L.","lastName":"Lam","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T12:56:29Z","dateModified":"2018-09-24T11:20:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/K87YZW9U","itemID":175,"key":"K87YZW9U"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540699237136,"version":0},"$loki":105},{"itemID":220,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/j.1550-8528.1993.tb00029.x","volume":"1","issue":"6","pages":"469-474","publicationTitle":"Obesity Research","ISSN":"10717323","date":"1993","DOI":"10.1002/j.1550-8528.1993.tb00029.x","accessDate":"2018-08-20T13:00:05Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"The relationships between increases in body mass index (BMI) and increases in hypertension were compared between non-drinkers with elevated serum y-glutamyl transpeptidase (y-GTP) levels (250 U/l) and those with normal levels, who comprised 10,952 men and 22,107 women aged 40-59 years recruited from an occupational health clinic. Hypertension was found in 16.1% and 13.5% of the men and women, and elevated serum g-GTP was found in 10.8% and 2.8% of the men and women, respectively. The prevalences of hypertension and elevated serum yGTP levels were both increased with increased BMI. Hypertension was, however, shown to be 1.5 times more prevalent in the persons with elevated serum yGTP levels than in those with normal levels in both sexes, even after adjusting for BMI by a multiple logistic analysis. It can be concluded that elevations of serum y-GTP, which are probably a reflection of fatty liver in the non-drinkers, are closely related to the development of hypertension associated with increased obesity.","title":"Serum γ-Glutamyl Transpeptidase Levels and Hypertension in Non-drinkers: A Possible Role of Fatty Liver in the Pathogenesis of Obesity Related Hypertension","shortTitle":"Serum γ-Glutamyl Transpeptidase Levels and Hypertension in Non-drinkers","creators":[{"firstName":"Eriko","lastName":"Ikai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuka","lastName":"Noborizaka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ikiko","lastName":"Tsuritani","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ryumn","lastName":"Honda","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Masao","lastName":"Ishizaki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yuichi","lastName":"Yamada","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T13:00:05Z","dateModified":"2018-09-29T08:15:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/EVLP98L9","itemID":220,"key":"EVLP98L9"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540699256102,"version":0},"$loki":106},{"itemID":203,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048878","volume":"7","issue":"11","pages":"e48878","publicationTitle":"PLoS ONE","ISSN":"1932-6203","date":"2012","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0048878","accessDate":"2018-08-20T12:58:44Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","abstractNote":"Background: Several prospective observational studies suggest that gamma-glutamyltransferase(GGT) level is positively associated with risk of hypertension. However, these studies draw inconsistent conclusions. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the exact association between GGT level and subsequent development of hypertension.\nMethods: We searched Pubmed, Embase, and Science Citation Index (ISI Web of Science) for prospective cohort studies examining the association between GGT level and hypertension. Then, pooled effect estimates (RRs) for the association between GGT level and hypertension were calculated.\nResults: A total of 13 prospective cohort studies including 43314 participants and 5280 cases of hypertension were included. The pooled RR of hypertension was 1.94(95%CI: 1.55–2.43; P,0.001) when comparing the risk of hypertension between the highest versus lowest category of GGT levels. Moreover, the risk of hypertension increased by 23% (summary RR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.13–1.32; P,0.001) per 1 SD logGGT increment. Subgroup analyses showed significant positive associations in each subgroup except in §160/95 subgroup (RR: 2.56, 95%CI: 0.87–7.54; P = 0.088) and nondrinkers subgroup (RR: 1.76, 95%CI: 0.88–3.53; P = 0.113). Sensitivity analyses showed no single study significantly affects the pooled RRs. No publication bias was found in our meta-analysis.\nConclusions: GGT level is positively associated with the development of hypertension. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and elucidate the exact mechanisms between GGT level and the incidence of hypertension.","title":"Gamma-Glutamyltransferase Level and Risk of Hypertension: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","shortTitle":"Gamma-Glutamyltransferase Level and Risk of Hypertension","creators":[{"firstName":"Cun-Fei","lastName":"Liu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Yu-Ting","lastName":"Gu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hai-Ya","lastName":"Wang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ning-Yuan","lastName":"Fang","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Antony","lastName":"Bayer","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T12:58:44Z","dateModified":"2018-10-07T04:35:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/X34SQM9F","itemID":203,"key":"X34SQM9F"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540969262622,"version":0},"$loki":107},{"itemID":229,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.najms.org/text.asp?2012/4/10/496/102000","volume":"4","issue":"10","pages":"496","publicationTitle":"North American Journal of Medical Sciences","ISSN":"1947-2714","date":"2012","DOI":"10.4103/1947-2714.102000","accessDate":"2018-08-20T13:00:49Z","libraryCatalog":"Crossref","language":"en","title":"Association between serum gamma-glutamyl transferase level and hypertension in Indian adults: A population based cross-sectional study","shortTitle":"Association between serum gamma-glutamyl transferase level and hypertension in Indian adults","creators":[{"firstName":"Subhasish","lastName":"Dan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Indranil","lastName":"Banerjee","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Himangshu","lastName":"Roy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Shiuli","lastName":"Roy","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Tamoghna","lastName":"Jana","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Satrajit","lastName":"Dan","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-08-20T13:00:49Z","dateModified":"2018-08-20T13:00:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/MS8IBQ2J","itemID":229,"key":"MS8IBQ2J"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1540969312438,"version":0},"$loki":108},{"itemID":547,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"book","url":"http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS16589","publisher":"[Bethesda, Md.] : The Institute","date":"2002","extra":"T.p. verso: NHLBI Obesity Education Initiative, Expert Panel on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults \nCitation Key: trove.nla.gov.au/work/20742334 \nbibtex{type:'Book; Book/Illustrated',subjects:'Obesity -- Prevention; Obesity -- Treatment; Obesity; Weight loss; Obesity -- diagnosis; Obesity -- therapy','catalogue-url':'https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/20742334'}","language":"English","title":"The practical guide : identification, evaluation, and treatment of overweight and obesity in adults","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"National Institutes of Health (U.S.)","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":["ZU6QJNUJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-01T08:37:55Z","dateModified":"2018-11-01T08:39:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/QwMIPxLl/items/N4QSCZZV","itemID":547,"key":"N4QSCZZV"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1541061598116,"version":0},"$loki":110},{"itemID":435,"legacy":false,"skipChildItems":true,"item":{"version":0,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/193847","volume":"285","issue":"19","pages":"2486-2497","publicationTitle":"JAMA","ISSN":"0098-7484","date":"2001","journalAbbreviation":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.285.19.2486","accessDate":"2018-09-17T07:35:36Z","libraryCatalog":"jamanetwork.com","language":"en","abstractNote":"The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment\nof High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP III)\nconstitutes the National Cholesterol Education Program's (NCEP's) updated\nclinical guidelines for cholesterol testing and management.
