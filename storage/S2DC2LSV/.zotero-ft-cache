Estimationof the Concentrationof Low-Density LipoproteinCholesteroiln Plasma,Without Useof the PreparativeUltracentrifuge

William T. Friedewald, Robert I. Levy, and Donald S. Fredrickson

A method for estimating the cholesterol content of the serum low-density lipoprotein fraction (Sf0.20) is presented. The method involves measurements of fasting plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, none of which requires the use of the preparative ultracentrifuge. Corn parison of this suggested procedure with the more direct procedure, in which the ultracentrifuge is used, yielded correlation coefficients of .94 to .99, depending on the patient population compared.

constant and about 5:1 in normal subjects (1, 4)

and in patients with all types of hyperlipoprotein-

emia, except the rare Type III (1,2). The other is

that when chylomicrons are not detectable, most

of the triglyceride in plasma is contained in the

VLDL. Thus, in the vast majority of plasma samples

in which chylomicrons are not present, the choleste-

rol in plasma attributable

to VLDL can be approxi-

mated by dividing the plasma triglyceride con-

centration by five. The justification of this method

for estimation of CLDL is the subject of this paper.

An important requirement

for classification

of

hyperlipidemia

into the different types of hyper-

lipoproteinemia

(1, 2) is the estimation of the con-

centration of plasma LDL1 (Sf 0-20; the beta lipo-

proteins). This quantity is necessary for the assign-

ment of the Type II pattern (1-3), which is defined

as an increase rn LDL concentration above some

arbitrarily selected cut-off limit.

An indirect method is presented here for estimat-

ing the plasma LDL concentration in terms of the

cholesterol contained in this lipoprotein (C LD L).

The method requires measurement of the concen-

trations of plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides,

and CHDL. This information can be obtained with-

out ultracentrifugation

and requires only routine

lipid analyses in addition to a rapid precipitation

of all plasma lipoproteins other than HDL. Two

observations

are used in the calculation. One is

that the ratio of the mass of triglyceride to that of

of cholesterol in VLDL is apparently

Methods

Data were obtained from lipid and lipoprotein

analyses performed

by the Molecular

Disease

Branch of the National Heart and Lung Institute,

on samples from patients with hyperlipidemia

and

from normal subjects. The results of the laboratory

analyses are in the process of transfer to magnetic

tapes for rapid retrieval and analysis. At the time

of this study, complete lipoprotein analyses from 448 subjects classified as either normal, Type II, or

Type IV primary hyperlipoproteinemia

had been

transferred to tapes and the data from all were

used. The data reflect the research interests of the

Branch, with most of the data coming from pa-

tients with familial hyperlipoproteinemia

or their

relatives, and as such do not represent an unbiased

sample of the general population.

The specimen

from each patient chosen for analysis in this paper

was the first sample on magnetic tape on which

a complete lipoprotein analysis had been performed

at the National Heart and Lung Institute. The

subjects were receiving no dietary or drug treat-

ment for hyperlipoproteinemia

at the time of this

sampling, except for two patients who were on

caloric restriction

but who were subsequently

classified as Type IV.

The original plasma samples had been obtained

12 to 14 h after the last meal, mixed with EDTA

(1 mg/ml), and immediately stored at 4#{176u}nCtil

analyzed. Total plasma cholesterol (6) and tri-

glycerides (6) were measured, and data on CHDL,

CLDL, and CVLDL obtained by a combination of

ultracentrifugation

and precipitation procedures

(7). In samples free of chylomicrons the CVLDL was

measured in two ways: (a) directly, by measuring

the cholesterol content of the supernatant fraction

after ultracentrifugation

of plasma at D.1006 for

16 h at 100,000 X g in a Spinco 40.3 rotor, and (b)

indirectly, by subtracting the cholesterol content of

the infranatant fraction (the sum of the CHDL and

CLDL) from the total plasma cholesterol. A method-

ologic error was presumed and the plasma re-

analyzed if there was a large disparity between

the results of the two methods.

Subjects were classified as normal or as having

hyperlipoproteinemia

Type I through V according

to criteria previously described (1, 2).

Resu Its

The results of lipid and ultracentrifuge lipopro-

tein determinations

in 232 men and 216 women-

96 normal, 204 with Type II, and 148 with Type

IV-were

analyzed. Various statistics derived

from these data are presented in Table 1.

CLDL was also calculated for each person accord-

ing to the following formula:

C LDL = Cpa,ma - CHDL

TG/5

Plots of each individual’s CLDL as calculated by

this method vs. that obtained after preparative

ultracentrifugation

(7) are presented in Figures 1

to 3. For normal people and Type II patients the

spread of points about the line of equality for the

two methods does not appear excessive, as reflected

in the high correlation coefficients, .98 and .99,

respectively (8). However, in Type IV patients

there are many outlying values and the correlation

is somewhat lower, namely, .85. Closer scrutiny of

these outliers revealed that most such patients had

very high plasma triglyceride concentrations, and

thus a plot was made of only those Type IV pa-

tients with plasma triglycerides less than 400

mg/100 ml (111 of the original 148 people). The

spread of values is much smaller after these are

Further quantitative expressions for the disagreement between the C LD L obtained by the two methods are presented in Table 2. Because each of the confidence intervals (9) contains zero, there is no compelling reason based on these data to believe

that the estimate of CLDL will be biased. The tolerance intervals (10) give the range of values

that with probability .95 will include 95% of the differences between the two methods of measure-

ment. The per cent error assumes that the CLDL

measured by the ultracentrifuge

method is the

standard with which the CLDL estimate obtained by calculation is being compared. The distribution of values by each method was examined for each of the groups, by use of normal probability graph

paper. The values were reasonably normally distributed. Only in the Type IV patients was there evidence of skewness; this was only minimal, and in the negative direction.
We did not attempt to calculate the overall average error or to estimate the probability of misclassification by this estimation procedure because of the unusually large number of Type II and Type IV patients relative to normal people in the sample.
A subsample of 46 Type II patients was randomly chosen, a linear least-squares (11) fit of TG to CVLDL was performed, and the equation so obtained was used in a separate subset of 55 Type II patients to estimate their CVLDL. Analysis revealed that simple division of TG by five provided as accurate an estimate of CvLDL as did this more complicated regression estimate.

Discussion

The method presented here for estimating

plasma LDL concentrations provides a reasonable

approximation that is useful for many purposes.

There are, however, three important restrictions

on its use. First, it is not applicable to plasma

samples containing chylomicrons. However, such

samples are characterized by a “cream” layer on

top of plasma that has been stored at 4#{176fo}rC 18 h

or more. Chylomicrons are characteristic of lipo-

protein patterns classified as Types I and V, in

which the CLDL concentration is not abnormally

increased. Particles having similar appearance are

also sometimes seen in Type III.

Second, the technique for estimating CLDL gives

erroneously high results in the rare patient with

Type III hyperlipoproteinemia.

the VLDL are of two kinds (12). One is the normal variety having the usual triglyceride-to-cholesterol ratio of about five. The other form is unique in having beta mobility on electrophoresis and an
abnormally high content of cholesterol relative to triglyceride. Division of the total plasma triglyceride concentration by the factor five yields a falsely low value for the “VLDL” and falsely high value for the “LDL” contribution to the total plasma cholesterol. Thus, when this formula is used, a Type III patient may be falsely classified as a Type II. The anomalous lipoproteins in Type III are detectable with certainty only by ultracentrifugal isolation of VLDL and determination of either its electrophoretic mobility or cholesterol and triglyceride content (1-3).
Third, CLDL cannot always be accurately estimated when the plasma triglyceride concentration exceeds 400 mg/100 ml. It is noteworthy, however, that only two of the 204 Type II patients in this series had triglyceride concentrations of 400 mg/ 100 ml or greater. This suggests that few errors in
classification would occur if patients with plasma triglycerides exceeding 400 mg/100 ml, in the absence of chylomicrons, were directly classified as Type IV. The frequency of this misclassification will no doubt depend in part on the cut-off limits used in defining an abnormal LDL concentration.
It is noteworthy that despite the good agreement between the estimation and actual measurement of CLDL, simple division of the plasma triglyceride by five does not give a very accurate estimate of the VLDL cholesterol alone, even in normals or patients with Type II or Type IV. In normals and patients with Type II the average VLDL cholesterol concentration is low (see Table 1), and thus even small absolute errors yield large percentage errors. In Type IV the average VLDL cholesterol concentration is higher, but large percentage errors still result. However, when the estimate of CVLDL is used to calculate CLDL the percentage error does decrease to an acceptable level because the absolute error in CVLDL estimation is small relative to the concentration of CLDL.
Of some concern is the number of Type IV patients with relatively large values for ILDLU-

LDLEJ (see Table 2 and Figure 3), which of course

greatly influences the per cent error of the whole

group. To examine this problem more closely, we

identified all Type IV patients with an ILDLU-

LDLEI value greater than 20 mg/100 ml and

their entire laboratory profile on tape was re-

evaluated. Of the 16 people so examined, 13 had

evidence of an undetected methodological error

identified by a large disparity between the actual

indirect and direct measurements of CVLDL (see

Methods). This suggests the possibility that the

larger percentage error seen in the Type IV pa-

tients may be due in part to laboratory errors in

the ultracentrifuge

calculation of LDL cholesterol

rather than greater inaccuracy of the estimation

procedure.
