Introduction
Representative data on the prevalence of hypertension in a Bangladeshi population are lacking. A few studies with small sample sizes have been done which cannot provide sufﬁcient information due to their non-representativeness of Bangladesh at large. Moreover, estimates for adults are lacking in most of the studies. In this report we synthesise these articles to describe the prevalence of hypertension in a larger sample of a Bangladeshi adult population.
Methods
Articles published on the prevalence of hypertension among the people of Bangladesh were identiﬁed by MEDLINE search. Care was taken not to include more than one study per survey. We could locate six articles.1–6 Three1–3 of them were excluded from the current analysis because they did not describe the essential information, criteria for diagnosis of hypertension. The remaining three4–6 were included in this analysis for an adult age group of 18 years or older.7 One article4 used this cut-off point for age but two others5,6 did not. Therefore, we considered the nearest cut-off point they used: 20 years5 and 15 years.6 Then the prevalences of hypertension and their 95% conﬁdence intervals for the individual studies were calculated by using the data presented. Finally a pooled estimate was obtained for these three studies.
Results
The studies are summarised in Table 1, and the calculated prevalences and their 95% conﬁdence intervals are presented. The pooled estimates for the prevalence of hypertension in 13 288 adults (urban

8172, rural 5166) is 11.3% (95% conﬁdence interval 10.8% to 11.8%). It is evident from the table that the data gathered so far and synthesised in this article report the prevalence of hypertension in Dhaka only.
Discussion
One important point to note is that none of these studies used classical deﬁnition for hypertension which incorporates systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and history of medication for hypertension.7 Two studies4,5 calculated prevalence on the basis of diastolic blood pressure. The third6 used two separate estimates using cut-off points for systolic (Ͼ140 mm Hg, 10.5%) and diastolic blood pressure (9.0%) (Table 1) but not their combination. We used the latter estimate to maintain comparability with other studies included in this analysis. As regards to the history of antihypertensive medication, two studies4,5 made confusing (or incomplete) statements. They presented tables for a subgroup of subjects with a diastolic blood pressure у95 mm Hg in which the proportion of subjects with antihypertensive medications were mentioned. However, it was not mentioned what they did if there was somebody with antihypertensive medication and a diastolic blood pressure Ͻ95 mm Hg. The third study6 mentioned nothing about antihypertensive medication. Therefore, the prevalence presented here is a conservative one. Moreover, none of the studies presented age-standardised prevalence, which is necessary for comparability with other populations. We also did not calculate it because the age limits presented were confusing or age groups were not suitable for such calculation.
Although this simple meta-analysis does not provide data representative of Bangladesh, it gives a more informative estimate than individual studies do. Large-scale study using classical deﬁnition for hypertension that would be representative of Bangladesh at large remains to be done.

*Our prior deﬁnition of adult was the subjects aged 18 years or above. However, we used data presented for the nearest age group. **95% CI was calculated as p ± 1.96[p(1-p)/n]0.5, where p indicates proportion of subjects with hypertension. #Authors did not mention exact location of the village, but stated that it was 20 km away from Dhaka city.
