yGlutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)genomicsequences were isolated from rat and human libraries using a rat GGT cDNA as a cross-species hybridization probe. Characterization of the human GGT clones by restriction mapping clearly establishes that at least four dif-
ferent GGT genes or pseudogenes are present in the human genome. All the rat genomic clones cover a 12.5-kilobase sequence and exhibit a unique restriction pattern. A precise quantitation of the rat GGT
gene copy number by Southern blot analysis demonstrates that this sequence is present as a single copy/ rat haploid genome. Therefore, the GGT gene organization is different betweenrat and human species; this raises the possibility of different regulatory mechanisms in the twospecies.

regulation of GGT activity awsell as itscell specificity clearly requires a detailed analysis of its genes. We recently isolated a nearlyfull-lengthcDNA sequence from rat kidney GGT mRNA which hybridizes to human GGT RNA under conditions that indicatae strong homology between the two species (12). Using this cDNA aas probe,we now report the isolation and characterizationby restriction mappingof rat and human genomic DNA sequences. From the analysisof these genomic sequences we conclude that GGT isencoded by a single copy gene in the rat whereaasfamilyof GGT genes or pseudogenes is present in the humagnenome.

Rat cDNA sequences were inserted in the PstI site of PBR 322 (clones 1,3,and 39)(Ref. 12)or at the PuuII-PstsIites inthe polylinker of the pSP64 vector (clone 39.1)(Ref. 17).All the restriction sites used to prepare the different cDNA probes are shown.

for 1 h in 0.5 X SSC, 0.1% SDS a t 55 "C for 1 h. Screening of Rat and HumanLibraries-Approximately 3 haploid
genome eq of the rat and human libraries were plated using E. coli strain LE392 a t a density of about 5.10' plaques/plate. The bacteriophage DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filters according to Benton and Davis (15).The filters were processed as described by Grunstein and Hogness (16). The rat genomic library was screened using the ratkidney cDNA sequence 39.1 (1600 base pairs) extending from the most 5' PuuII site to the most 5' Pst site of the rat kidney cDNA and subcloned in the plasmid pSP 64 (17)(Fig. 1).The human genomic library was screened using the ratkidney cDNA insert from clone 1 (Fig. 1).These two probes were purified by electroelution from agarose gels and radiolabeled by nick translation to a specific activity of 10' cpm/pg. Filters were prehybridized in 6 X SSC, 1 X Denhardt's solution containing 200pg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA for 5 h a t 68 "C;hybridization was performed overnight a t 68 "C in 2 X SSC, 1 X Denhardt's solution, 0.05% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaH2P04, pH7.2,containing 200 pg of salmon sperm DNA and 50 ng of the probe (10-30.lo6cpm). The filters were washed in 0.1 X SSC, 0.1% SDS at 58 "C. Positive signals were taken through an additional five rounds of screening at lower plaque density. Plate stocks were made from each positive clone. Recombinant bacteriophages, amplified in liquid medium (18),were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation and through two cesium chloride gradient centrifugations (19).
Restriction Endonuclease Mapping-Single or double restriction digestion was carried out according to the recommendations of the enzymesuppliers. Digestionswere followed by DNsAize fractionation on a 0.8% agarose gel. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized to anick-translated cDNA probe as described for genomic DNA. The dataobtained from the different digestions were used to construct the restriction map.
Evaluation of Rat GGT Gene Copy Number-This evaluation was carried out by Southern blot analysis according to Zehner and Paterson (20).Total ratgenomic DNAand genomic GGT sequences cloned in the bacteriophage Charon 4A were digested by EcoRI. Known amounts of rat genomic DNAwere loaded on a 1% agarose gel along with increasing amounts of EcoRI-digested genomic clone corresponding to a known number of copies of the GGT gene. Salmon sperm DNA, digested by EcoRI, was added to the cloned DNA in order to load the same amount of material in each lane. The nitrocellulose blot was hybridized to anick-translated 39.1 rat cDNA probe as described above. Followingautoradiography, the radioactivity that hybridized to theEcoRI fragments was counted. The number of GGT gene copies was directly estimated by comparing the counts in the two EcoRI genomic DNAfragments to standardcurves where the radioactivity found in cloned genomic DNA sequences had been plotted against the number of gene copy equivalents/haploid genome.

the clone 39. The very simple hybridization pattern observed with the rat samples suggests that there is only one gene coding for the GGT in the rat (Fig. 2A). Following digestion by XbaI, HindIII, BamHI, EcoRI, and BglII, a single restriction fragment hybridized tothe cDNA probes, while two fragments were detected following digestion by KpnI. Under the same experimental conditions,the patternobtained with the human genomic DNA prepared from lymphocytes is more complex (Fig. 2B). In the human DNA samples digested by the different restriction enzymes, three to seven fragments were found to hybridize to the rat cDNA probe. This complexity indicates that there are probably several GGT sequences in the human genome.
Isolation and Characterization of the Human GGT Genomic Clones-Screening of approximately 6.105clones from the human genomic library, using the rat cDNA clone 1 (Fig. 1) as a probe, resulted in the purification of 14 positive clones containing inserts ranging from 10to 15 kb. A restriction map of the DNA inserts was established by digesting the 14phages with the EcoRI, KpnI, HindIII, and BamHI endonucleases separately and with all the possible double combinations. The maps, as well asthe hybridization experiments described below, revealed that all the different clones share anidentical pattern for only some EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI,and BamHI sites (Fig. 3A), but divergences occur for some other sites distributed along the sequence. Differences in the restriction map allow the identification of a t least four different gene types in the human genome (F30,FI5,F19,FI1).
The 5' to 3' orientation of the different genomic clones, with respect to the rat kidney mRNA, was determined. The different genomic phages digested by BamHI and HindIII were hybridized to PstI-KpnI andKpnI-KpnI fragmentsfrom clone 39 (Fig. 1).The probe PstI-KpnI recognizes the same HindIII-BamHI fragment in the four different phages. This fragment is located upstream from the HindIII-Hind111 or BamHI-BamHI sequences which hybridized to theKpnI-KpnI probe (Fig. 3A).

After transfer to nylon membrane, the DNA fragments were hybridized to the nick-translated EcoRI-PuuII sequence from clone 39 as described under "Methods." The nylon membrane was autoradiographed a t -80 "C for 48 h with an intensifying screen.

ization conditions. All the clones were shown to be identical by restrictionmapping analysis. Digestion of the 12.4-kb insert of these clones by EcoRI gives three fragments of 6.4, 3.9, and 2.1 kb (Fig. 3B).
The 5' to 3' orientation of the cloned genomic sequences, with respect to GGTmRNA, was determined by hybridization to two probes which correspond to two different regions of the mRNA. The cDNA 39.1 probe hybridizes to the 3.9- and 6.4-kb EcoRI fragments, whereas the EcoRI-PuuII fragment from clone 39, a 3"specific probe, recognizes only the 6.4-kb fragment; this result shows that the6.4-kb fragment contains the most 3' sequences and that theunique EcoRI site found in the cDNA separates the 3.9- and 6.4-kb genomicfragments. Within the 6.4-kb fragment, the EcoRI-PuuII cDNA probe hybridizes only to the 2.1-kb EcoRI-XhoI sequences, thus indicating that alteast 98% of the mRNA coding region maps on the 5' side of the most 3' XhoI site (Fig. 3B).
The rat GGT genomic clones hybridize to the PvuII-NcoI cDNA fragment but not to thcDe NA insert from clone 3 (Fig. 1) (data not shown). This means that the cloned genomic sequence extends beyond the NcoI site of the rat cDNA. Therefore we isolated a 12.5-kb genomic sequence which contains the 3' end of the ratgene and approximately 72% of the sequence coding for the polypeptide chain. Hybridization of kidney genomic DNA digested by EcoRI reveals a 15-kb fragment which was not cloned. This fragment hybridizes also to the cDNA from clone 3 and therefore contains sequences corresponding to the5' end of the gene. We are now attempting to clone the 5' end of the rat GGT gene from another genomic library.
Copy Number of Rat Genomic GGTSequences-Evaluation of the gene copy number of the GGT sequences in the rat genome was carried out by Southern blot analysis. Known amounts of total genomic DNA and of cloned genomic sequences were digested by EcoRI, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose. After hybridization tothe cDNA insert 39.1 (Fig. l ) , two EcoRI fragments (3.9 and 6.4 kb) were detected in the standard lanes and three (3.9, 6.4, and 15 kb) inthe lane containingthe total ragt enomic DNA (Fig. 4A).A precise quantitation of the gene copy number was done by comparing radioactivity counted in the two 3.9- and 6.4kb EcoRI genomic fragments to the standarcdurves (Fig. 4B);

The DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filter and hybridizedto cDNA insert 39.1 as described under "Methods." The sizes of the detected fragments were determined by running size DNA markers on the same gel. The blot was autoradiographed for 48 h a t -80 "C using an intensifying screen. B, the radioactivity counted for each spot was plotted against the number of gene copy equivalents loaded in the standardtracks. With increasing gene dosage, there is alinear increase in the hybridization signal in the standard tracks for both the 3.9 and the6.4 EcoRI fragments. The arrows mark the radioactivity values for the same EcoRI fragments in the totalgenomic DNA.

this quantitation clearly established that thetwo fragments, and therefore that the GGTgene, are represented only once per rat haploid genome.
DISCUSSION
In this paper we report the isolation and restriction maps of genomic clones corresponding to one rat GGT gene and several human GGT genes or pseudogenes. Characterization, by restriction map analysis of the different phages from the human library, establishes the existence of a multigene GGT family in humans which includes a t least four different types of genes. Hybridization experiments to rat cDNA, as well as preliminary sequencing data, allow us to estimate tmhienimal length of the GGT gene to be 15 kb; comparison of the size of the gene to the 2.2-kb GGT sequence detected in human fetal liver mRNA (12) demonstratesan intron-exon structure. The GGT gene hybridization pattern of genomicDNA on Southern blots is in agreement with the presence of several GGT sequences in the human genome. The extensive crosshybridization with the rat cDNA under stringent conditions indicates that thefour human GGTgenes that we identified are highly homologous. One cannot exclude the possibility that among these four types of genes, two of them represent

Thetwo insulin gene sequences are closely related since they code for two preproinsulins which differ by only seven amino acids; the divergence reaches 22% in theDNA silent sites.Another example of recent gene duplication is given by the relaxin gene which is represented once in the rat genome (23) and twice in the human genome
(24). The physiological significance of GGT gene duplication in
the human genome remains to be established. The human GGT genes could be expressed independently in different
