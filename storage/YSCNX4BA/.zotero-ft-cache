Abstract
A series of epidemiological studies have suggested serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) within its normal range might be an early marker of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress appears to be a key component of many reactions associated with chronic inﬂammation. Therefore, we examined the cross-sectional association between deciles of serum GGT and concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of chronic inﬂammation, among 12,110 adult participants in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. After adjustment for race, sex, age, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and body mass index (BMI), serum concentration of GGT across all deciles was positively associated with serum concentrations of CRP (P for trend < 0.01). For example, adjusted relative risks of serum CRP ≥ 3.0 mg/L by deciles of serum GGT were 1.0, 1.23, 1.40, 1.59, 1.62, 1.61, 2.17, 2.38, 2.45, and 3.41 (P for trend < 0.01). This association was consistently observed among all subgroups; Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, men, women, non-drinkers, drinkers, non-smokers, ex-smokers, current smokers, BMI < 25, BMI 25–29.9, and BMI ≥ 30. The strong association of serum GGT and CRP suggest that further studies on cellular and/or serum GGT might help to elucidate the association between oxidative stress and inﬂammation. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction
Recently, in an attempt to improve global cardiovascular risk prediction, considerable interest has focused on C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inﬂammation that has been shown in multiple prospective epidemiological studies to predict incident myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and sudden cardiac death [1,2].
On the other hand, serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels within normal range was strongly associated with most cardiovascular disease risk factors and predicted the development of heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and type 2 diabetes [3–9]. In particular, serum GGT level has

shown a strong graded relationship with incident diabetes, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes [4,5]. Although serum GGT activity has been commonly used as a marker for excessive alcohol consumption or liver diseases [10], neither alcohol consumption nor liver dysfunction likely explained these associations [4,5]. A series of Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) studies [5,11,12] suggested that oxidative stress might explain these associations because serum GGT within normal range had dose-response relations with serum and/or dietary antioxidant vitamins and markers of oxidative stress such as F2-isoprostanes. Although the relationship between cellular GGT and serum GGT is not known, cellular GGT has been known to play an important role in antioxidant defense systems [13–16]; paradoxically, cellular GGT may also be involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species in the presence of transition metals [17–21].

Oxidative stress appears to be a key component of many reactions associated with chronic inﬂammation [22–24]. Multiple oxidative processes play a critical role in inﬂammation and act on various intra- and extracellular pathways through speciﬁc mediators in conjunction with free radicals that amplify inﬂammatory reactions at speciﬁc sites [22–24]. In this context, the CARDIA ﬁnding of serum GGT predicting future concentrations of CRP in a dose-response manner could be of substantial interest. To our knowledge, however, the CARDIA ﬁnding [5] is the only report examining the association of serum GGT with CRP concentration. Therefore, we investigated the association between serum GGT and CRP concentration among another group of subjects, namely a representative sample of the US population using the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).

smoking status (no-smoker, ex-smoker and current smoker), alcohol intake (g/day), and body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2). In this study, the internal validity was a more important issue than generalization to the total US population, therefore we did not use a speciﬁc analytic method to consider the sampling frame of NHANES III.
We repeated the same analyses after stratifying by race (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, versus Mexican American), sex (men versus women), alcohol consumption status (non-drinkers versus drinkers), smoking status (nonsmokers, ex-smokers, versus current smokers), and BMI (<25, 25–29.9, versus ≥30). For the stratiﬁed analyses, quintile of serum GGT was used for statistical stability.
For a comparison with serum GGT, we reanalyzed the association between serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a more liver-speciﬁc enzyme, and serum CRP. Serum ALT levels were also classiﬁed as deciles; cutoff points of deciles of serum ALT were 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 22, and 30 U/L (normal range: <40 U/L for men, <31 U/L for women).

A detailed description of NHANES III can be found elsewhere [25]. Brieﬂy, NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, was a national probability sample designed to provide national estimates of the health and nutritional status of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 2 months and older. Of the 18,825 NHANES III participants aged 20 years and older, we excluded 6518 with missing serum GGT or CRP and 288 who were pregnant, leaving 12,110 individuals available for analysis.
The NHANES III data collection included a standardized home interview followed by a detailed physical examination in a mobile evaluation clinic or the participant’s home. Information on a wide variety of sociodemographic, medical history, nutritional history (food frequency questionnaire), and family history questions, such as self-reported age, race/ethnicity, gender, history of smoking, alcohol consumption, use of vitamin supplements, and 24 h dietary recall, were obtained during the home interview.
Laboratory methods and quality control procedures are described in detail elsewhere [25]. A venous blood sample was collected and shipped weekly at −20 ◦C. Serum GGT concentration was assayed using a Hitachi 737 Analyzer (Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) at White Sands Research Center. Serum CRP was analyzed using latex-enhanced nephelometry. The limit of detection for this assay was 3.0 mg/L; subjects with undetectable levels were assigned a level of 2.1 mg/L.
Serum GGT levels were classiﬁed as deciles; cutoff points of deciles of serum GGT were 11, 14, 16, 19, 21, 25, 31, 40, and 62 U/L (normal range: 11–51 U/L for men, 7–33 U/L for women). Serum CRP level was right-skewed, so results were presented as geometric means of serum CRP level across deciles of serum GGT levels. We also presented results using cutpoints of ≥3.0 mg/L to deﬁne “detectable” levels and ≥10.0 mg/L to deﬁne “highly elevated” levels. Linear and logistic regression models were adjusted for age, race, sex,

3. Results
The average age of the sample was 48.8 years. The proportions of ethnic groups were 44.0% for nonHispanic white, 27.9% for non-Hispanic black, 23.5% for Mexican–American, and 4.6% for others. There were more females (52.8%) than males (47.2%) in the sample.
Serum GGT, mostly within normal range, was positively associated with serum CRP in a dose-response manner whatever criteria of serum CRP was used; geometric means, ≥3.0 mg/L, or ≥10.0 mg/L (Table 1). For example, adjusted relative risks of serum CRP ≥ 3.0 mg/L by deciles of serum GGT were 1.0, 1.23, 1.40, 1.59, 1.62, 1.61, 2.17, 2.38, 2.45, and 3.41 (P for trend < 0.01). On the contrary, serum ALT was not positively, if any inversely, associated with serum CRP. Adjusted relative risks of serum CRP ≥ 3.0 mg/L by deciles of serum ALT were 1.0, 0.92, 0.87, 0.75, 0,87, 0.77, 0.74, 0.81, 0.79, 0.86 (P for trend = 0.02).
The strong positive association of serum GGT with CRP was similarly observed among all subgroups; NonHispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Mexican American, men, women, non-drinkers, drinkers, non-smokers, exsmokers, current smokers, BMI < 25, BMI 25–29.9, and BMI ≥ 30 (Table 2).
4. Discussion
In this sample of the US population, we documented that serum GGT concentrations within its normal range are strongly and positively associated with serum CRP levels. This positive association was consistently demonstrated in all subgroups we examined. However, serum ALT, an enzyme more speciﬁc to the liver, was not positively associated with serum CRP. It is not possible to discern causal direction of

association from this cross-sectional study. However, in the CARDIA study [5], serum GGT concentrations predicted future serum CRP levels which was measured 15 years after the earlier GGT measurement and 5 years after the later in dose-response manners. They similarly predicted ﬁbrinogen, another biomarker of inﬂammation and F2-isoprostanes, a highly regarded biomarker of lipid peroxidation. Taken together with other CARDIA ﬁndings of inverse associations of serum GGT with serum and dietary antioxidant vitamins and positive associations with dietary heme iron [11,12], we argue that serum GGT within its normal range is a sensitive and early marker of oxidative stress.
Supporting our argument, cellular GGT has been known to play an important role in antioxidant defense systems [13–16], although the relationship between serum GGT and

cellular GGT is unknown. Cellular GGT catalyzes the initial step in the degradation of extracellular glutathione, thereby providing a supply of constituent amino acids for uptake and reutilization in intracellular glutathione synthesis. However, recent experimental studies [17–21] clearly indicate that GGT may also be involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species in the presence of iron or other transition metals.
Although highly elevated serum GGT has been commonly used as a marker of alcohol consumption or liver dysfunction [10], population-based studies [3–9] have observed a strong association between serum GGT levels, mostly within normal range, and many cardiovascular disease risk factors. The factors showing a positive association with elevated serum GGT level in the population studies include: old age, male gender, body mass index, smoking, lack of exercise, high blood pressure, heart rate, high blood cholesterol, high blood fasting triglycerides, high blood LDL cholesterol, low blood HDL cholesterol, high fasting glucose, and, among women, menopause and use of oral contraceptive [3–9]. In addition, baseline serum GGT level was an independent risk factor for the development of heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and type 2 diabetes [4–9]. The associations of serum GGT within normal range with many cardiovascular risk factors and/or events might be explained by a mechanism related to oxidative stress.
On the other hand, the prognostic value of serum GGT for cardiac death and non-fatal infarction was conﬁrmed among ischemic patients with established coronary atherosclerosis and previous myocardial infarction [26]. The signiﬁcance of serum GGT was more evident among patients with vulnerable plaques. The authors suggested that potent catalysis of lowdensity lipoprotein oxidation through the ability of GGT to enhance iron reduction by GSH might be an important mechanism in atherosclerosis [27]. They also reported the ability of GGT-mediated GSH catabolism to stimulate the reductive delocalization of iron ions bound to transferrin, a physiological source of iron [28].
Compelling evidence for the importance of inﬂammation and atherosclerosis at both the basic and clinical level has evolved in parallel [1,2]. To date, elevated level of several

inﬂammation mediators among apparently healthy men and women have proven to have predictive value for future vascular events. For clinical purposes, the most promising inﬂammatory biomarker appears to be CRP, a classical acute-phase marker and a member of the pentraxin family of innate immune response proteins. More than a dozen population-based studies have demonstrated that baseline CRP levels predict future cardiovascular events. CRP testing may thus have a major adjunctive role in the global assessment of cardiovascular risk.
Oxidative stress has been implicated in initiating inﬂammatory response through chromatin modelling (histone acetylation/deacetylation), the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 leading to gene expression of pro-inﬂammatory mediators [21–23]. Our current and previous studies [5] suggest that elevation of serum GGT is involved in the inﬂammatory response. It is plausible that elevation in GGT might occur before elevation in CRP, if oxidative stress leads to an inﬂammatory response.
At present, both experimental and epidemiological studies on serum or cellular GGT are at a beginning stage. The strong association of serum GGT and CRP suggest that further studies on cellular or serum GGT might help to elucidate the association between oxidative stress and inﬂammation.
