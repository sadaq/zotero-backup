abstract
Background: Plasma activities of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are often increased in cardiometabolic diseases. We investigated if hypertension is associated with increased activities of these plasma markers. Methods: We included 235 hypertensive and 708 normotensive subjects (mean age 47.3 ± 9.6 and 58.0 ± 10.2 years respectively) from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study-2 (CRISPS-2) in 2000–2004 who had drank b 1/week. In the follow-up study in 2005–2008 (CRISPS-3), 126 out of the 708 subjects had developed hypertension. Results: Raised plasma ALT (OR = 1.22 per SD of log-transformed level, P = 0.045) and GGT (OR = 1.38 per SD of log-transformed level, P = 0.001) levels were associated with hypertension at baseline in CRISPS-2 after adjusting for covariates. Among subjects not on anti-hypertensive medications, plasma ALP, ALT and GGT were related to blood pressure (P b 0.01). In subjects normotensive at CRISPS-2, plasma GGT, but not ALP, ALT and AST, was an independent predictor of new-onset hypertension at CRISPS-3 (OR = 1.38 per SD of log-transformed level, P = 0.020 and OR = 2.68 for 3rd tertile vs. 1st tertile, P = 0.004) after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions: Among the 4 plasma markers, increased GGT activity is the strongest predictor for existing and new-onset hypertension in Hong Kong Chinese.

1. Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is caused by the accumulation of fat in the liver in subjects who do not drink alcohol in excess [1]. It has recently been suggested as the hepatic manifestation of obesity and the metabolic syndrome [1]. In NAFLD, plasma markers of liver injury such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are often increased [2].
Apart from liver diseases, these enzymes, especially GGT, have been suggested to be novel markers of cardiovascular diseases [3]. Increased plasma GGT activity has been shown to be associated with hypertension and its development in previous studies in Japanese [4– 6], Korean [7], and Caucasians [8,9]. However, all these studies

investigated GGT but not the other enzymes, i.e., ALP, ALT, and AST [4– 9]. We previously reported that plasma ALP correlates with the inﬂammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), in Hong Kong Chinese [10] and Americans [11]. As CRP is known to predict the development of hypertension [12], ALP may also be related to the latter. Moreover, increased plasma ALT is already known to precede the development of the metabolic syndrome [2] and type 2 diabetes [13–17]. Therefore, we hypothesized that plasma markers of liver injury other than GGT may also be increased in hypertension and predict the future risk of hypertension. If this hypothesis is true, the routine liver function test may help to monitor the risk at minimal extra cost. As there is no prospective study on the relationship of hypertension with all the four plasma markers of liver injury, especially in Chinese, we investigated whether plasma ALP, ALT, AST, and GGT were associated with hypertension in a population-based prospective cohort of Hong Kong Chinese. Since alcohol drinking can increase plasma markers of liver injury and may have confounding effect, we limited our analysis to subjects who had alcoholic drinks less often than once a week.

2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
The subjects were from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study-2 (CRISPS-2), details of which have been described previously [18–21]. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong and all subjects gave written and informed consent. Among the 1944 subjects in the CRISPS-2 study in 2000–2004, plasma activities of all the 4 markers of liver injury were available in 1371 subjects, and only 1197 of whom had alcoholic drinks less often than once a week. Among these subjects, 943 were followed up in 2005–2008 (CRISPS-3) after a median interval of 5.3 years and were included in this analysis.
2.2. Variables of interest
Plasma ALP, ALT, AST, and GGT were measured on a Hitachi 912 analyzer. Hypertension was deﬁned as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, or taking anti-hypertensive medication. Blood pressure was measured 3 times using a mercury sphygmomanometer by a trained nurse. The readings were taken in a seated position after resting in a quiet temperature-controlled room. The Korotkoff V sound was used to determine DBP. The ﬁrst measurement was to familiarize the subject with the procedure and the sensation of the inﬂated cuff. The mean of the second and third readings was used for data analysis. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as the sum of DBP and onethird of the difference between SBP and DBP. Data on alcohol drinking, smoking, and history of hypertension were obtained by interviewing using a questionnaire. Details of the physical examination and measurement methods of clinical parameters, such as triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, fasting glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), ﬁbrinogen, and plasma highsensitivity CRP had been described previously [18–23].
2.3. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Variables with skewed distribution were log-transformed before analysis. Multiple linear or logistic regression models were used to estimate the standardized regression coefﬁcient (β) or odds ratio (OR) respectively after adjusting for covariates. Variables were used as covariates in the multiple regression analysis if they are recognized determinants of blood pressure or were signiﬁcantly different between subjects with and without hypertension. For variables that were highly correlated such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, only one was entered into the regression analysis. In a separate analysis, similar results were obtained when BMI was replaced by waist circumference in the adjustment model. The P values for interaction were estimated by including each multiplicative interaction term in the multivariate regression models in full sample after adjusting for the main effects of all covariates. A 2-tailed P b 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the subjects in CRISPS-2 according to the hypertension status. Among 708 subjects normotensive in CRISPS-2, 126 subjects had developed hypertension in CRISPS-3. As expected, subjects with prevalent or incident hypertension were older, had higher BMI, waist circumference, SBP, DBP, MAP, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose and HOMA-IR, and had lower HDL cholesterol. Subjects hypertensive at baseline had a higher plasma ﬁbrinogen concentration but less likely to be smokers.

In CRISPS-2, all the 4 plasma markers of liver injury were higher in subjects with prevalent hypertension (Table 1). Among 809 subjects not on anti-hypertensive medication in CRISPS-2, the plasma activities of most markers were signiﬁcantly associated with SBP (ALP: β = 0.185, P b 0.001; ALT: β = 0.137, P = 0.001; and GGT: β = 0.155, P b 0.001), DBP (ALP: β = 0.184, P b 0.001; ALT: β = 0.149, P b 0.001; AST: β = 0.088, P = 0.011; and GGT: β = 0.171, P b 0.001), and MAP (ALP: β = 0.200, P b 0.001; ALT: β = 0.156, P b 0.001; AST: β = 0.081, P = 0.015; and GGT: β = 0.178, P b 0.001) after adjusting for age and sex. In a separate analysis, inclusion of the 134 treated subjects using adjusted blood pressure (by adding 10/5 mm Hg to blood pressure [24]) produced similar results (data not shown). As women had signiﬁcantly lower plasma activities of all the 4 markers than men (P b 0.001 after adjusting for age and BMI), sex-speciﬁc cut-points were used to deﬁne the tertiles of the plasma activities in subsequent analysis. As shown in Table 2, plasma GGT were signiﬁcantly associated with prevalent hypertension in the full adjustment model (P = 0.003 for continuous data and P for trend = 0.008 for tertiles). Plasma ALT was also associated with prevalent hypertension with a borderline signiﬁcant P value of 0.045 when the plasma activity was analyzed as continuous data. There was no signiﬁcant interaction of plasma GGT and ALT with sex (P N 0.05). The clinical characteristics of subjects according to the sex-speciﬁc tertiles of plasma GGT activities are shown in Table 3. In CRISPS-2, plasma GGT activity increased with increasing age, BMI, waist circumference, SBP, DBP, MAP, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, plasma CRP, plasma ALP, plasma ALT and plasma AST, and decreased with increasing HDL cholesterol (all P b 0.05, Table 3). Plasma ﬁbrinogen and the proportion of smoking did not differ signiﬁcantly with plasma GGT tertiles.
Among subjects normotensive in CRISPS-2, those who had developed hypertension in CRISPS-3 had signiﬁcantly higher plasma activities of ALP, ALT, and GGT (Table 1). However, only the association of plasma GGT with incident hypertension remained signiﬁcant in the full adjustment model (Table 4). There was no signiﬁcant interaction of plasma GGT with sex (P = 0.207 for tertiles and 0.072 for continuous activities) and other covariates (P N 0.05 after adjustment for multiple testing). The association of plasma GGT tertiles with incident hypertension was signiﬁcant in subjects with BMI b 25.0 kg/m2 and BMI≥ 25.0 kg/m2 (P for trend= 0.038 and 0.042 respectively). Similar results were obtained when baseline SBP in the adjustment model was replaced by baseline DBP or MAP (data not shown).
4. Discussion
We report the relationship between all the 4 plasma markers of liver injury and hypertension in a population-based prospective cohort. We demonstrated that only plasma GGT, but not the other markers, was associated with hypertension at baseline and incident hypertension. Our results are consistent with previous ﬁndings on the association of plasma GGT with hypertension or pre-hypertension in cross-sectional [25–28] and prospective studies [4–9]. The mechanisms underlying the association of GGT with hypertension have not been fully elucidated. Plasma GGT is usually used as a marker of alcohol intake. In this study, the subjects were not regular alcohol drinkers, but increased GGT activity was still associated with both prevalent and incident hypertension. Previous studies also found a similar association in both drinkers and non-drinkers [8,26]. Therefore, the association cannot be explained by alcohol drinking.
Recently, GGT has been suggested as a novel biomarker of cardiovascular risk [3]. Its increased activity has been shown to be associated with the metabolic syndrome in cross-sectional studies [29,30]. In prospective studies, increased GGT activity can predict incident elevation in plasma ALT [31], and the development of cardiovascular diseases, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular mortality [30,32–34]. In the Framingham Offspring Study, plasma GGT correlated positively with BMI, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol,

explained by insulin resistance [36]. Indeed, plasma GGT has also been reported to be predictive of incident diabetes [8,37,38] and the close relationship between raised blood pressure and dysglycemia in our population may also contribute to the association of plasma GGT with

hypertension [21]. However, in our study, plasma GGT predicted incident hypertension, even after adjusting for covariates including the insulin resistance index, HOMA-IR. Plasma GGT has been suggested as a marker of oxidative stress [3,39], a risk factor of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. GGT is a key enzyme in the catabolism of glutathione and plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species through modulating the redox status of cell surface

protein thiols [40]. In a clinical study, serum concentrations of antioxidants can predict GGT level at 10 years, but not vice versa [39]. A prospective study of American adults revealed signiﬁcant association of plasma GGT with hypertension only among subjects who were overweight or had increased central body fat [9]. This may suggest fatty liver as an underlying mechanism for the association of plasma GGT with hypertension. Our previous work suggested that plasma

GGT correlates with plasma CRP [10,11], so increased GGT may reﬂect inﬂammation that occurs in fatty liver.
Plasma ALP was associated with blood pressure among subjects not on anti-hypertensive medication in CRISPS-2. Although plasma ALP tertiles were not signiﬁcantly related to hypertension, plasma ALP correlated with SBP and DBP when these were treated as continuous variables. The association of plasma ALP with blood pressure could be explained at least in part by its correlation with plasma GGT activities [10,11,41]. Increased plasma ALT is associated with the development of the metabolic syndrome [2] and type 2 diabetes [13–17], which are closely related to hypertension in our population [19,21]. In our study, plasma ALT was not an independent predictor of prevalent and incident hypertension in stepwise logistic regression analysis.
There are some limitations in this study. The cohort of this study is community-based and so the number of subjects with prevalent and incident hypertension is relatively small. The degree of variations in plasma ALP, ALT, AST, and GGT among subjects and within an individual may inﬂuence the degree of signiﬁcance of their association with hypertension. Elevations of ALP, ALT, AST, and GGT in plasma can be non-speciﬁc and found in other diseases such as hepatitis, biliary diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and myocardial injury. However, these non-speciﬁc causes of elevation in plasma markers of liver injury are likely to diminish rather than augment the observed association.
In conclusion, among the four plasma markers of liver injury, GGT is the strongest risk factor for hypertension in Hong Kong Chinese. Therefore, further studies to assess the utility of GGT as a biomarker for hypertension and related diseases are warranted.
