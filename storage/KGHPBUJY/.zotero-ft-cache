What is cardiovascular disease?

    Statistics

Cardiovascular diseases involve the blood vessels, the heart, or both.

The cardiovascular or circulatory system supplies the body with blood. It consists of the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries.

There are several types of cardiovascular disease, but treatment, symptoms, and prevention often overlap.
Fast facts on cardiovascular disease:

    High blood pressure is a significant risk factor.
    Major cardiovascular disease related life-threatening events include heart attack , stroke , and aneurysm .
    Prevention includes balanced diet and exercise.

Treatment
Man experiencing pain and holding his chest.
One of the most common symptoms of cardiovascular disease is chest pain, which may indicate angina.

Treatment will depend on the type of condition the person has.

Options include :

    lifestyle adaptations, such as weight control, exercise, quitting smoking , and dietary changes
    medication, for example, to reduce LDL cholesterol
    surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
    cardiac rehabilitation, including exercise and counseling

Treatment aims to:

    relieve symptoms
    reduce the risk of the condition recurring or worsening
    prevent complications

Depending on the condition, it may also aim to stabilize heart rhythms, reduce blockages, and widen the arteries to enable a better flow of blood.

Symptoms

There are many different types of cardiovascular disease. Symptoms will vary, depending on the specific type of disease a patient has.

However, typical symptoms of an underlying cardiovascular issue include:

    pains or pressure in the chest, which may indicate angina
    pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back
    shortness of breath, also known as dyspnea
    nausea and fatigue
    light-headed or faint
    cold sweat

Overall, symptoms vary and are specific to the condition and the individual, but these are most common.

Risk factors

Researchers from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine reported in JAMA that the lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease is more than 50 percent for both men and women. They added that even among those with few or no cardiovascular risk factors, the risk is still more than 30 percent.

Risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease include:

    high blood pressure ( hypertension )
    radiation therapy
    smoking
    lack of sleep
    high blood cholesterol (hyperlipidemia)
    diabetes
    diets that are high in fat combined with carbohydrates
    physical inactivity
    drinking too much alcohol
    stress
    air pollution
    chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and reduced lung function

People with one cardiovascular risk factor often have one or two others, too. For example, people with obesity often have high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes type 2.

The most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease appear to be atherosclerosis and hypertension.
Causes

Important causes of cardiovascular disease include atherosclerosis , when fatty deposits accumulate in the arteries.

Damage to the circulatory system can also result from diabetes and as the result of other health conditions, such as a virus, an infection, or a structural problem that the person was born with.

It often involves high blood pressure, but this can be both a cause and a result of cardiovascular disease.

Types

Cardiac, or heart-related, diseases and conditions include:

    angina, considered both a cardiac and vascular disease
    arrhythmia , where there is an irregular heartbeat or heart rhythm
    congenital heart disease , when a problem with heart function or structure is present from birth
    coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the arteries that feed the heart muscle
    dilated cardiomyopathy
    heart attack
    heart failure , when the heart does not work properly
    hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
    mitral regurgitation
    mitral valve prolapse
    pulmonary stenosis
    rheumatic heart disease , which can be a complication of strep throat

Vascular diseases are diseases that affect the blood vessels: the arteries, veins, or capillaries.

They include:

    peripheral artery (arterial) disease
    aneurysm
    atherosclerosis
    renal artery disease
    Raynaud's disease (Raynaud's phenomenon)
    Buerger's disease
    peripheral venous disease
    stroke, a type of cerebrovascular disease
    venous blood clots
    blood clotting disorders

Prevention

Smoking is a significant risk factor for CVDs. Quitting can help reduce the risk of many other conditions.

The majority of CVDs are preventable. It is important to address risk factors by:

    consuming less alcohol and tobacco
    eating fresh fruit and vegetables
    reducing salt intake
    avoiding sedentary lifestyles, particularly among children

Bad habits during childhood will not lead to cardiovascular disease while the individual is still young; but they can lead to the accumulation of problems that continue into adulthood, resulting in a greater probability of having a cardiovascular disease later in life.

Children who eat a lot of salt have a much higher risk of hypertension when they are adults, as well as heart disease and stroke. Parents should also keep a close eye on how much saturated fat and sugar a child consumes.
Does aspirin protect from cardiovascular disease?

Aspirin , also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a medication that is generally used to treat minor pains; it is also used as an antipyretic (to reduce fever ) and as an anti-inflammatory.

Aspirin has become popular as an antiplatelet drug - to prevent blood clots from forming. High-risk patients take it in low doses to prevent strokes and heart attacks. Aspirin is also given to patients after a heart attack to prevent cardiac tissue death or heart attack recurrence.

A major problem posed by aspirin therapy for patients at risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular events is major bleeding. A considerable proportion of patients with diabetes have a high rate of major bleeding, regardless of their therapeutic aspirin status.
Statistics

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths globally. More people die from these diseases than from anything else.

In 2015, approximately 17.7 million people died from cardiovascular disease worldwide, and they accounted for 31 percent of all registered premature deaths.

Of these:

    7.4 million people died from coronary heart disease
    6.7 million people died as a result of a stroke

Over 75 percent of deaths from cardiovascular disease occur in low and middle-income countries. They affect men and women equally.

By 2030, it is predicted that 23.6 million people will die from cardiovascular diseases annually, mostly due to stroke and heart disease.

For women in the United States, heart disease is the leading cause of death. In 2013, there were 289,758 fatalities in women due to cardiovascular disease. One in every four female deaths were from heart disease.
