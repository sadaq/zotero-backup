Abstract

A kinetic method is described for the determination of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity in serum. Optimal conditions for the reaction were ascertained, normal values in milliunits per milliliter at 25° established, and the reliability of the method examined. γ-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide in ammediol-HCl buffer at pH 8.2 is employed as substrate. The method requires only 0.1 ml. of serum and, using an automatic cuvet positioner and recorder as well as an automatic diluter, more than 60 determinations can be carried out in 1 hr. On the basis of a large number of determinations, the method was shown to be technically excellent and clinically valuable.

    Received for publication March 16, 1968.
    Accepted for publication June 21, 1968.
