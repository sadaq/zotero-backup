Abstract Background: Hypertension in children is often under recognized, especially in developing countries. Data from rural areas of developing countries is particularly lacking. Objectives: To study prevalence of hypertension and its determinants in apparently health school children from predominantly rural populations of India. Methods: Apparently healthy schoolchildren (n ¼ 14,957) aged 5–15 years (mean (standard deviation) age 10.8 (2.8) years; 55.5% boys) at four predominantly rural sites in separate states of India were studied. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded by trained staff in addition to age, gender, height, weight, type of school and season. Waist circumference was also recorded in 12,068 children. Geographic location and type of school (government, governmentaided or private) were used to determine socio-economic status. Results: Systolic and/or diastolic hypertension was present in 3443 (23%) children. Systolic hypertension was present in 13.6%, diastolic hypertension in 15.3% and both in 5.9%. Isolated systolic hypertension was present in 7.7% while isolated diastolic hypertension was present in 9.4%. On univariate analysis, age, gender, geographical location, socio-economic status, season and anthropometric parameters (z-scores of height, weight and waist circumference, waist/height ratio and body mass index) were all significantly related to risk of hypertension (p < 0.0001 for each). Similar association was observed with weight group (normal, overweight and obese). Multiple regression analysis showed lower age, female gender, richer socio-economic status, certain geographical locations, higher weight and larger waist circumference to be independently associated with a greater risk of hypertension. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of hypertension in apparently healthy schoolchildren even in predominantly rural areas of India. Screening and management programs targeted to high risk groups identified may prove cost-effective.

Introduction
There is increasing interest in blood pressure (BP) and hypertension (HT) in children.1–3 HT in children has been shown to be associated with HT in adulthood and with cardiovascular risk in later life.4–8 The adverse eﬀects are shown to increase in the presence of obesity,

of which the world is currently witnessing an epidemic.9 The recording of BP has also become easier with widespread availability of reliable oscillometric (digital) BP recording instruments. These can be used by paramedical and even lay people, including parents, to record BP at home or at school.
There is also increasing interest in regional variation in BP and in the prevalence of HT since reports from diﬀerent parts of world have shown wide variations.10–13 The pattern may be diﬀerent in developing countries since obesity is less of a problem there as compared to the Western world. Moreover, children from rural areas are less well studied than their urban counterparts. It will also be important to determine the prevalence of HT in undernourished (rather than overnourished obese) children. We report here the prevalence and factors determining HT in schoolchildren in four predominantly rural areas located in diﬀerent parts of India.
Methods
This cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in primary and secondary schools in four states in India (Haryana, Goa, Gujarat and Manipur) as part of a rheumatic heart disease screening program. Details of the method of the study are already published.14 Informed consent for the project was gained from each school principal as well as the parents. The study was approved by institutional ethics committees at all sites. Children with known major hepatic, renal, cardiac, or respiratory diseases were excluded. For the current analysis, apparently healthy schoolchildren with completed age of 5–15 years were included (n ¼ 14957). The children were screened by clinical examination and echocardiography and those found to have signiﬁcant heart disease were excluded.
During the survey, trained paramedical staﬀ documented demographic and anthropometric data, including height, weight, and waist circumference. Waist circumference was recorded in 12,068 of the total of 14,957 children (it was not recorded at one site). Children sat and rested for ﬁve minutes before measurement of BP. BP was measured in a sitting position by trained medical attendants. It was measured using oscillometric instrument in Haryana (Omron HEM 7080) and Gujarat, anaeroid instrument in Manipur and mercury sphygmomanometer (Diamond(R)) at Goa. The digital and aneroid instruments were calibrated against a mercury sphygmomanometer. Children with a high BP reading underwent a repeat BP measurement by research physicians after an interval of about ﬁve minutes and the second reading was taken as the ﬁnal one. All children with BP values which were normal for their age did not have a repeat

BP check. Two cuﬀ sizes were used in this study according to the size of the child. No child was excluded based on BP reading.
Socioeconomic status (SES; ‘‘richer,’’ ‘‘poorer,’’ or ‘‘mixed’’) was assigned to each school depending on type of school and development of the area where the school was located. This SES was applied to all participating children from that school. The season when BP was measured was taken to be ‘summer’ for April– September months and ‘winter’ for other months. HT was deﬁned as given by the established Fourth report using BP according to age and gender tables but with 50th centile for height taken for all children.7,12,15 We have earlier reported simpliﬁed percentile tables and charts derived from the BP measurements of 7761 children from one of these sites (Haryana).11
Statistical analysis
Data is presented as mean (standard deviation (SD)) unless speciﬁed otherwise. Ninety-ﬁve percent conﬁdence intervals were calculated whenever appropriate. The z-scores were used for anthropometric parameters (height, weight, and waist circumference) as standardized values (using age, gender, and site).
For univariate analysis, the Student’s t-test was used for comparison of continuous variables and the Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables between hypertensive and non- hypertensive children. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of HT. For this purpose, weight, height were divided by 10 to obtain the odds ratio for every 10-unit change rather than oneunit change. Similarly, waist circumference was divided by ﬁve for multiple regression. Children were divided into weight categories of normal, overweight, and obese. Overweight was deﬁned as weight in the 85th– 95th percentile, while obesity was deﬁned as weight greater than the 95th percentile for age and gender of the child. Graphs of prevalence of HT versus continuous variables like age were plotted using the LOESS curve ﬁtting (local polynomial regression) technique. The shaded areas indicate 95% conﬁdence intervals unless stated otherwise. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.3.3.
Results
Table 1 shows age and gender distribution of children included in the study. Mean (SD) age was 10.8 (2.8) years and 55.5% were males. The mean (SD) height was 136.7 (16.6) cm, weight was 31.5 (11.8) kg, waist circumference was 55.0 (9.8) cm, and body mass index (BMI) was 16.3 (3.1) kg/m2.

Number (proportion) of children studied at four sites, i.e. Gujarat, Goa, Haryana, and Manipur, were 2324 (15.5%), 1939 (12.9%), 7761 (51.9%) and 2933 (19.6%), respectively. The SES was ‘‘richer’’ for 47.6%, ‘‘poorer’’ for 39.4%, and ‘‘mixed’’ for 13% children. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 2.
Prevalence of different types of HT
The overall prevalence of HT (systolic, diastolic, or both) was 23%. Systolic HT was present in 13.6%, diastolic HT in 15.3%, and both systolic and diastolic HT were present in 5.9% children. Isolated systolic HT was present in 7.7% while isolated diastolic HT was present in 9.4% (Table 2).
Univariate analysis (Table 3)
Geographic location vs prevalence of HT. The prevalence was 9.9%, 13.6%, 26.5%, and 29.9% at the four sites of Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, and Manipur, respectively (p < 0.0001). The prevalence was much higher at the two northern sites than the southern sites which are also closer to the ocean (see map in Figure 1).
Prevalence of HT vs age and gender. The overall prevalence of HT in boys was 20.2% and that in girls was 26.5% (p < 0.0001). Figure 2(a) shows the relationship of prevalence of HT with age in boys and girls. Prevalence of HT was seen to decline with age, especially in boys. From age of 5–15 years, the prevalence of HT reduced from 33% to 16.3% in boys and from 30.1% to 23% in girls.

Anthropometric parameters versus prevalence of HT. The prevalence of HT was found to be positively related to z-scores of height, weight, and waist (p < 0.0001 for each). There was also a positive relation with waist-height ratio (p < 0.0001) and body mass index (p < 0.0001). The relationships with various anthropometric parameters in boys and girls are shown in Figure 3. Waist z-score and waist height ratio have the most linear relationship with the prevalence of HT.
The prevalence of HT in normal, overweight, and obese children was 20.7%, 32.6%, and 42%, respectively (p ¼ 0.0001). Figure 2(b) shows the prevalence of HT at diﬀerent ages in obese and overweight children as compared with the rest. The risk was found to be highest in the obese but there was considerable overlap with overweight children.
Socio-economic factors versus prevalence of HT. Analyzing for socio-economic status, the prevalence of HT was 29.9%, 19%, and 9.9% in richer, poorer, and mixed groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). Figure 2(c) shows the prevalence of HT in each of these three groups to be consistently diﬀerent at most ages.
Season versus prevalence of HT. The prevalence of HT was higher (29.4%) in the group whose BP was measured in winter (October–March) as compared with those where it was measured in summer (April–September) months (18.7%; p < 0.0001). Figure 2(d) shows the prevalence of HT to start rising at the end of summer, reaching a peak in the ﬁrst two months of the year, with a smaller rise during the peak of summer as well. This pattern is seen in both boys and girls.

Multiple regression analysis
Since waist circumference was not recorded at one site (Gujarat), multiple regression analysis was performed both excluding and including this variable. Age, gender, site, SES, height, weight, and season were other predictor variables in the model. Height and weight were divided by 10 to obtain odds ratios for each 10-unit

change in parameter. For similar reasons, waist circumference was divided by ﬁve.
In the ﬁrst analysis without waist circumference, complete data was available for 14,957 children from all four sites (Figure 4(a)). Age, male gender, lower SES, sites of Goa and Gujarat were independently associated with lower risk while weight, site of Manipur, and winter season were independent predictors of a

higher risk of HT. The value of p was < 0.0001 for all these except for lower SES (p ¼ 0.002). For height the value of p was of borderline signiﬁcance (p ¼ 0.047).
In the second analysis which included waist circumference, complete data was available for 12,068 children from three sites. The same predictor variables as above were taken in addition to waist. Higher age, male gender, and site of Goa were independently associated with a lower risk of HT while weight, waist, and winter season were independently associated with increased risk of HT. The odds ratios are shown in Figure 4(b).
Discussion
Bassareo et al. called pediatric HT a ‘‘burning problem’’ and emphasized that management of HT in

children should be considered a preventive measure (p. 257).16 The problem of obesity HT in children has reached epidemic proportions in the western world and is rising rapidly in the developing world.9 A disturbingly high cumulative incidence of HT has been reported in Chinese children (50.1% and 70% in overweight and obese children, respectively).11 A major ﬁnding of our study is also a high prevalence of HT amongst Indian children. Studies on newer aspects of HT in children, such as the relation to adult-derived genetic BP scores, prenatal exposure to maternal stress, and the eﬀect of traﬃc-related air pollution, are also being reported.17–19
Highly signiﬁcant associations (p < 0.0001) found in our univariate analysis are likely related to the large sample size of this study. A signiﬁcant variation of

the prevalence of HT between diﬀerent geographical locations was observed. This variation could be due to local diet (especially salt intake) as well as other environmental factors (including temperature, humidity, exercise habits etc.). The prevalence was higher at two sites which are located more in the north and have lower ambient temperatures over the year. The two sites with lower prevalence are also closer to the ocean, where higher humidity could cause increased perspiration and hence salt and water loss from body. Additionally, ethnic variation and genetic factors could also be important.
Contrary to expectation, we found the prevalence to be higher in younger children and in females, though this has been observed in other studies as well.10,20 The prevalence of HT at the upper end of our age group could be aﬀected by the onset of puberty, though we did not study this aspect.
A clear relationship between anthropometric variables and the prevalence of HT found in our study is consistent with earlier reports. Multiple regression analysis including waist circumference showed that weight, and to a lesser extent waist, were independent predictors, while height was not. Our data strengthens the evidence that obesity is an important risk factor for the prevalence of HT. The association

of richer SES with higher prevalence of HT was also expected. Since this relationship is independent of obesity in our analysis, other factors such as psychosocial stress and greater intake of salt and processed foods in the higher SES group could be contributing mechanisms.
There was a signiﬁcant association of prevalence of HT with season of the year, and higher prevalence was found in winter months. Increase of BP in winter months has also been reported in several earlier studies.21–23 It is most likely due to increased salt and water loss with perspiration during hot weather that occurs during the summer months in most parts of the country.
Measurement of BP on a single day raises the possibility that the prevalence observed in our study represents a falsely high value. Chiolero et al. found the prevalence to be lower if measurements were repeated over a period of a few weeks.24 The possibility of overestimation of the prevalence of HT was also highlighted by Wirix et al.25 Another confounding factor could be using the 50th percentile of height values for all children to classify HT using Fourth report tables. However, a number of reports have stressed the need for simpliﬁcation of the current deﬁnition of HT for children.26–29 A recent update of

Age, gender, winter season, Goa site, and weight are significant and independent predictors of hypertension in both models. Waist was significant predictor in second model.

the Fourth report has also included a simpliﬁed screening BP table based on age and gender only.30
The high prevalence of HT seen in our study also
raises the possibility that Fourth report deﬁnition
(which is based on children in diﬀerent areas of the
USA) may not be applicable to Indian children.
Normative data is being reported from diﬀerent parts of the world.31–35 A recently published update to the
Fourth report has thresholds which are generally, though slightly, even lower.30 There have also been
attempts to develop a more representative international deﬁnition.1
There are many studies supporting the association of
childhood HT with cardiovascular risk in adulthood.
Chen et al. documented evidence of BP tracking from
childhood into adulthood in a meta-regression analysis.4 Theodore et al. found that preHT and HT in child-
hood are associated with the development of more
cardiovascular risk factors over time and predict adult cardiovascular risk.5 In the Bogulosa Heart Study,
Berenson et al. showed an association between multiple
cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis in children and young adults.8 In addition, systolic BP was
found to an independent predictor of arterial stiﬀness

in young adults, providing evidence that target organ damage also occurs as a result of childhood HT.8 In a recent further analysis, they reported BP trajectories from childhood to adult life and found puberty to be a critical stage in development of adult HT.36 Systolic BP was also one of the predictors of carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.6 Similarly, in the International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort Consortium study, of 4210 subjects, individuals with persistently elevated BP were found to be at higher risk of carotid atherosclerosis, as measured directly by CIMT, than those in whom high BP in childhood had resolved by adulthood.37 The diﬀerence persisted after controlling for age, gender, adiposity, and deﬁnition of HT used. Hence, there is a great deal of evidence that elevated BP in childhood causes target organ damage and an active approach to screening and managing childhood HT is likely to be rewarding.
We have recorded blood pressure twice only in children in whom the ﬁrst reading was high. It is possible that the prevalence may be higher if the mean of two recordings was taken for all children, as recommended by some published guidelines.38–40

Conclusions
Even in the predominantly rural populations of India, the prevalence of HT is high in childhood. Both systolic and diastolic HT are common. Richer SES, high weight (obesity), and increased waist circumference (abdominal obesity) are important independent predictors and eﬀorts should be made to contain the obesity epidemic. The relationship of higher risk of HT with lower age, female gender, certain geographical locations, and winter months needs further studies for conﬁrmation and to clarify underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. Factors identiﬁed in this study can help plan cost-eﬀective strategies of screening and management programs to control this widespread public health problem.

Prevalence and Predictor of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
S ALAMa, M ALAMb, SMNE ALAMc, ZR CHOWDHURYd, J KABIRe

Summary: Fatty liver is a common cause of chronic liver disease in developed as well as developing countries.We have designed this study to estimate the prevalence and predictors for non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We have included 493 patients with sonographic evidence of fatty change in liver and 177 of them had done liver biopsy for histopathological study. Other causes of liver disease and alcohol consumption were excluded. Metabolic syndrome and biochemical and anthropometric evaluation was done. Females were predominating 250 (57.0 %). Centrally obese 422 (96.2 %) was more than over all obesity330 (75.1%). NASH was absent in 10 (5.6%) cases and diagnostic of NASH was 75

(42.4 %).Presence of diabetes could significantly (p = 0.001) predicted NASH. Age, sex, BMI, waist circumference, Serum HDL,triglyceride, insulin resistance index, hypertension, metabolic syndrome could not predict NASH. Serum GGT level was significantly (p = 0.05) higher in NASHwith a sensitivity of 45 % and specificity of 68 % only. Serum ALT and AST level could not detect NASH. Females were predominant sufferer of NAFLD in Bangladesh. Prevalence of NASH was much higher42.4%. Diabetes was the main predictor of NASH. GGT was the only biochemical indicator of NASH. We recommend liver biopsy in NAFLD with diabetes and raised GGT.

Introduction: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicohistopathological entity with histological features that resemble alcohol-induced liver injury. By definition, occurs in patients with little or no history of alcohol consumption1. NAFLD is the most common liver disease in western countries, affecting 20-30% of the general population2,3. It encompasses a histological spectrum that ranges from fat accumulation in hepatocytes without concomitant inflammation or fibrosis (simple hepatic steatosis) to hepatic steatosis with a necro-inflammatory component (steatohepatitis)

that may or may not have associated fibrosis. The latter condition, referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may progress to cirrhosis in up to 20% of patients4. Reports have also suggested that the prevalence of NAFLD among Asian Indians is comparable to that seen in the West5, 6. Average age for NASH patients is 40-50 years and for NASH-related cirrhosis it is 50-60 years. NASH probably causes around 80% of cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis which accounts for 10-20% of all cirrhosis and progresses to advanced fibrosis in 32 to 37% of patients7.
In parallel with the epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome worldwide, the prevalence of NAFLD in Asian countries has increased rapidly with a trend to younger patients during the last two decades. The prevalence of NAFLD was about 15% in adults in Shanghai and Hong Kong8. NAFLD has been associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, even in lean subjects with normal glucose tolerance 9. Diabetes mellitus may be an independent predictor of NASH, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma10. NAFLD is now recognized as the hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome, which includes hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, obesity, and systemic hypertension. Predictors of NASH increase with the number of components of the metabolic syndrome11.The contrasting clinical course of NASH versus non NASH fatty liver (NNFL) indicates that these

two conditions diverge early in the course of NAFLD although some patients probably transition from NNFL to NASH. Progression to cirrhosis is usually preceded by longstanding histological NASH and is infrequent in NNFL. Longitudinal studies with serial biopsies have shown that about one-third of NASH patients develop advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4 fibrosis) over 5-10 years from the time of the initial diagnosis12. Although usually relatively slow, progression to cirrhosis can occur in as little as 2–3 years. NASH is a common cause of ‘cryptogenic’ cirrhosis, which accounts for 10 – 20% of all cirrhosis13. Among patients diagnosed with NASH–related cirrhosis, the risk of developing a major complication of portal hypertension is 17, 23 and 52% at 1, 3 and 10 years, respectively. Among patients with early stage NASH, overall mortality over 10–15 years is about 10–12%, being significantly higher in NASH versus NNFL, compared to the general population. The risk of developing decompensated cirrhosis is 5–10% and for hepatocellular cancer it is 1–2%. There is a tenfold risk of cirrhosis relative to the general population14.
A complete diagnosis of fatty liver disease ideally should define the histology, including the stage and grade of the disease as well as its etiology. In Bangladesh NAFLD is never been or insufficiently addressed in the field of medical research and practice. NASH is a potentially dangerous condition which requires medical intervention. The prevalence of NASH and potential risk factors for it is not yet explored here. We have designed this study protocol to estimate the prevalence of NASH in NAFLD and predictor of NASH in the perspective of Bangladeshwhich will be helpful future scientific knowledge and intervention.
Materials and Methods:
Study population: We have included initially 439 patients at outpatient department of Hepatology in the University Hospital during the period of March 2010- December 2012 for fatty filtration in liver with ultrasonography. Exclusion criteria consisted of significant alcohol abuse (< 20g daily), evidence of hepatitis B and C and of drug induced fatty liver and other specific liver diseases: Hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease or autoimmune liver disease. These patients underwent clinical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, and blood

tests. Liver biopsy was done after randomization in 190 patients but 4 biopsy samples were inadequate to comment for histopathology 4 patients withdrawn themselves from the study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and all individuals provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to Asian criteria,[15] and three of the five listed criteria were considered: waist circumference (WC) e”80 cm for women and e”90 cm for men, serum triglyceride >150 mg /dl (1.7 mmol/l) , serum HDL cholesterol <50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) for women and <40 mg/dl (1 mmol/ l) for men, elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure >130 and or diastolic blood pressure >85 mmHg or drug treatment for hypertension) and plasma glucose concentration e” 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) or drug treatment for diabetes.
Clinical and Biochemical evaluation: All the patients were clinically evaluated: Blood pressure, Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference was recorded for every patient. Liver function tests were performed prior to the liver biopsy. Blood samples were obtained under fasting conditions and the following tests were performed using standard laboratory methods: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, Gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) international normalized ratio (INR), blood glucose fasting and 2 hours after breakfast, lipid profile, Insulin level was assessed using the method of indirect chemiluminescence (MEIA). Insulin resistance was calculated according to the HOMA index (Homeostatic Metabolic Assessment).
Histological assessment Liver biopsy specimens of 182 were analyzed by pathologist blinded to the patients’ clinical and biochemical results. Histopathology was done in the department of Pathology BSMMU. The diagnosis of NASH was based on the Brunt et al criteria, [16]modified by Kleiner et al17. In this scoring system, the degree of disease activity in NAFLD was evaluated using the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), which was calculated as the unweighted sum of the scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3), and hepatocyte ballooning (0–2) and thus ranged from 0 to 8. A NAS of 5 or more was diagnosed as “definitive NASH”, NAS of 2 or

less as “non-NASH,” and 3 or 4 as “borderline NASH.” Other than NASH, was considered as NNFL. Hepatic fibrosis staging was as follows: 0 = no fibrosis; 1 = zone 3 fibrosis only; 2 = zone 3 and portal/periportal fibrosis; 3 = bridging fibrosis; and 4 = cirrhosis.
Statistical analysis Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for quantitative data and as numbers or percentages for categorical or qualitative data. Statistical differences in quantitative data were determined using t test or one way Anova test. Qualitative data were compared using the x2 test. Multivariate regression analysis was done to explore the strongest predictor of NASH including the variables with significance in univariate analysis. For all tests, significance was achieved at p < 0.05.
Results:
Patient Characteristics: Total of 439 patients wereincluded in this study. Females were 250 (57.0 %) and males were 189 (43.0 %). Mean age of the sample was 40.8 ± 10.2 years. Most of the population was house wife 217 (50.3 %), others were service holder 84 (19.5 %), business man 69 (16.0 %) and students were 59 (13.7 %). Hypertension and diabetes were prevailing in 83 (18.8 %) and 74 (16.8 %) respectively but metabolic syndrome was 188 (42.9 %). Triglyceride was high in 320 (72.8 %). BMI was normal in 51 (11.7 %), over weight 58 (13.2 %), Obese I 237 (53.9 %) and obese II 93 (21.2 %) according to criteria for Asian18. Most of the patients were centrally obese 422 (96.2 %) having waist circumference above normal. ALT, AST and GGT level were 54.1 ± 54.4, 45.1± 51.8 and 46.6 ± 33.7 u/l respectively. Insulin resistance index were higher than normal in 218 (49.6 %).
Histological Changes: Histopathological reports of 182 patients were available but 5 of them did not have fatty change on microscopy. We have included 177 patients for further analysis. There was no significant difference between biopsied and non- biopsied patient regarding clinical, anthropometric and biochemical variables. Steatosis of < 33% was 73(41.2%), 33 – 66 % was 82 (46.4 %) and > 66 % was 22 (12.4%). Lobular inflammation was absent in 10 (5.6 %), mild in 93 (52.5 %), moderate in 70 (39.5 %) and severe in 4 (2.3 %). Ballooning was absent in 5 (2.8 %), few ballooning in 138 (78.0 %) and prominent ballooning in 34 (19.2%) (Figure I). No fibrosis was seen in 28 (15.8%), stage I in 94 (53.3%), stage II in 40 (22.5 %) and stage III in 15 (8.3%). None had stage IV fibrosis(Table I).

According to NAS scoring system NASH was absent in 10 (5.6%) cases, borderline NASH was 92 (52.6%) and diagnostic of NASH was 75 (42.4 %). So NNFL was 102 (57.6%) and NASH was 75 (42.4%).

Predictors of NASH: Prevalence of NASH in NAFLD was 75 (42.4%). There were no significant difference of age, BMI, waist circumference, Serum HDL and triglyceride level, insulin resistance index,sex, hypertension, metabolic syndrome did not differed in NASH and Non NASH. Mean age, BMI and waist circumference was similar in NNFL and NASH patients. Mean triglyceride was higher in NASH and mean HDL was lower in NASH but could not establish statistically significant value. Presence of diabetes could significantly (p = 0.001) differentiate NASH from NNFL. Serum ALT and AST level could not detect NASH in NAFLD. But serum GGT level was significantly (p = 0.05) higher in NASH than that of NNFL (Table II). GGT level for NASH was (51.7 ± 32.8) U/L and for NNFL was (40.4 ± 22.6) U/L. Multivariate regression analysis also explore that presence of diabetes could influence the development of NASH (p= 0.04) and GGT could differentiate NASH from NNFL (p= 0.01) (table III). But area under the curve is 59.3 % for GGT to differentiate NASH, with a sensitivity of 45 % and specificity of 68 % only for 44.5 U/L (Figure II).

Prevalence and Predictor of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) in Nonalcoholic

S Alam et al.

Discussion: This study is the largest series from Bangladesh on NAFLD. Report of biopsy proven NASH and NNFL is also rare. University hospital is a tertiary care “center of excellence” hospital only and patients are referred from whole over the country. So this study may be the representative of prevalence of NASH in NAFLD of the country. Population based prevalence of NAFLD was not yet done in Bangladesh. Most of our NAFLD patients are of 30 to 50 years; this is similar to several reports from Asia6,19-20. But age could not influence the development of NASH. Female preponderance in NAFLD is dissimilar from reports from developed counties. Many recent studies have reported that male gender is a risk factor for fatty liver disease21. For example, in a study of 26,527 subjects undergoing medical checkups; the prevalence of NAFLD was 31% in men and 16% in women22. This female preponderance 250 (57.0 %) in our study may be the social conservative attitude which bounded most of our ladies to stay home for house hold activities without job leading to sedentary life style. Similar female preponderance was observed in one population studies from India23. But in accordance with previous studies sex did not influenced the development of NASH in NAFLD22.
Centrally obese was 422 (96.2 %) outnumbered the overall obesity 330 (75.1%). The prevalence of NAFLD was increased according to the increase of BMI or abdominal circumference reported from Japan24. But other report concluded that waist circumference is an independent predictor of advance histological changes in NAFLD than BMI25, 26. But waist circumference was similar in NASH and NNFL in our series. It could be explained by that waist circumference indicate visceral obesity but no influence on pathogenesis of NASH at the stage of 2nd hit. Hypertriglyceridemia was very common 320 (72.8 %) in this study with no difference between NASH and NNFL. TG was long been considered as major factor in the development of NAFLD,5-8 but there is mounting evidence that such non-TG lipid molecules are implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH by the process of lipotoxicity. Conversely, formation of TG may actually be a cytoprotective mechanism in liver27, 28. Our study revealed similar role of TG in NAFLD.
Our study explored that prevalence of NASH was 75 (42.4%) in NAFLD which is much higher. It is alarming

for the country like Bangladesh. It was neither addressed previously nor considered anyway. In previous review, NAFLD wasfoundhighly prevalent (15% to 45%) in modern societies, only 10% to 25% of cases develop NASH, hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma29.In other studies prevalence of NASH was 10 to 30 % in NAFLD 30 and it is less in Asian than that of European31.32 . We were unbiased in selecting patient for liver biopsy and it was irrespective of clinical, biochemical and anthropometric status of the study population. So it is the representative of prevailing situation in the society. This finding warrants further extensive study on prevalence of NASH in Bangladesh and awareness of clinician is essential to diagnose NASH and to advice possible intervention as early as possible.
Presence of diabetes signified the presence of NASH in our study population (p= .001). Metabolic syndrome was prevailing in 188 (42.9%) population. NAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance (IR) and other components of the metabolic syndrome, like T2DM, central obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension33. The pathogenesis of NASH appears to be a multiple hit process. The initial insult is the development of macrovesicular steatosis with the accumulation of hepatic fat from decreased hepatic free fatty acid oxidation and D or increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and D or decreased lipid export from the liver. Although IR can contribute to this dysregulation of lipid metabolism, once fatty liver develops, it can worsen hepatic IR and diabetes, contributing to a vicious cycle34.
Serum ALT and AST levels were similar in NASH and NNFL in this study. But GGT were significantly (P= 0.05) higher in NASH than that of NNFL. NASH has been associated with slight elevation of liver enzymes mostly ALT35. In other reports NAFLD patient typically present with asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations of 2-3 times the normal36 . This difference was due to different selection criteria. GGT is a sensitive indicator of liver damage37. Excess deposition of fat in the liver is associated with an elevated serum GGT38. Recent reports suggest that an increased GGT level is a risk factor for advanced fibrosis in NAFLD and, with weight loss, a decrease in GGT activity is predictive of improved lobular inflammation and fibrosis of liver39.

The limitation of the study was that we had not done it at the community level rather at a tertiary level hospital of the country.
In conclusion, Females were predominant sufferer of NAFLD in Bangladesh. Prevalence of NASH was much higher in NAFLD. Diabetes was the main culprit in developing NASH in NAFLD. GGT was the only biochemical predictor of NASH but with low sensitivity and specificity. We recommend liver biopsy in NAFLD with diabetes and raised GGT.

Abstract: We investigated the prevalence and factors associated with hypertension, its treatment, and control using individual-level data from 300,249 respondents aged 20 years and older from the Japanese National Health and Nutrition Survey for the period of 1975–2010. We applied multivariate random effects logistic regression to assess associations between the risk factors and the prevalence of hypertension, the proportion of uncontrolled hypertension, and the proportions of respondents seeking treatment and controlling hypertension. The trends in the effect of the birth cohort on uncontrolled hypertension were also examined. Having hypertension was associated with being male, older, obese, drinking alcohol, and working in the primary industry and a higher proportion of middle-aged men than women were found being obese and drinking alcohol. Seeking treatment was associated with being older, obese, drinking alcohol, working in a primary industry and exercising. Controlling hypertension was associated with being younger, underweight and exercising. The proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension declined for cohorts born in later years with a steeper decline for women than men. Raising awareness in the hypertensive population, especially among men, could help further reduce the prevalence of hypertension in Japan.

1. Introduction
Hypertension remains a leading global risk factor for death and disability. In 2011 the World Health Organization (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland) targeted a 25% global reduction in prevalence of hypertension by 2025 [1], but progress varies widely between countries. Over the past 50 years, the mean blood pressure of the Japanese population has seen a steady decline, but hypertension and smoking still remain the two biggest risk factors for non-communicable diseases, in particular, cardiovascular disease [2–4]. Understanding the trends in hypertension prevalence and management is essential to preparing strategies to target this risk factor in Japan. We used individual-level data from the Japanese National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHNS) from 1986 to 2010, and, where available, from 1975 to 2010, to explore the trends and risk factors for hypertension in Japan. We thus expand on previous investigations of blood pressure in the Japanese population [5–7] and aimed to:
• Analyze trends in and risk factors for uncontrolled hypertension over 35 years and for hypertension over 25 years
• Identify factors associated with seeking treatment and controlling hypertension

• Investigate changing patterns in the proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension by the birth cohort over 35 years.
Japan has made progress in reducing hypertension and improving management of this condition, but further work is needed. The results of this study may be used to plan interventions in speciﬁc population groups at risk of hypertension, and to raise awareness of the need for the identiﬁcation, treatment, and control of hypertension.
2. Method
2.1. Data Sources
This study used data from the NHNS between 1975 and 2010. The NHNS is a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted annually on a random sample of Japanese citizens in all 47 Japanese prefectures. The sample size was about 28,000 persons in 1975, 20,000 persons between 1976 and 1986, and gradually decreased to about 10,000 or less after 2000 [8,9]. In addition to answering a questionnaire, the respondents were invited to undergo a physical examination that included blood pressure measurements. The response rate to the physical examination was reported as around 50 to 60% [9,10]. Stratiﬁed randomization by prefecture and household in a two-stage cluster sampling design is used for participant selection [8,9,11]. Here, we restricted the analysis to respondents who were at least 20 years old, not pregnant, and whose systolic and diastolic blood pressure data were available. Fifteen-year age brackets were chosen to ensure sufﬁcient numbers of respondents in each age category.
2.2. Blood Pressure Measurement and Hypertension
Data on blood pressure values were available from 1975 to 2010 and data on hypertension medication were available from 1986 to 2010. Until 1999, the survey included one measurement of blood pressure in the sitting position, and from 2000 it included two measurements of blood pressure measured in the sitting position with a Riva-Rocci mercury sphygmomanometer after resting [5,11,12]. The two measurements were averaged for analysis, consistent with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare guidelines [13].
Hypertension was deﬁned as a systolic blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mmHg or the use of medication for hypertension, in line with the current World Health Organization (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland) guidelines [14,15]. Uncontrolled hypertension was deﬁned in the same way except that respondents who successfully controlled their blood pressure to the normal range by medication were counted as controlled. Values of 50 to less than 300 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 40 to less than 140 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure were considered valid. Values outside these extremes were omitted. Medicated hypertension was deﬁned as taking medication for hypertension regardless of successful control or not. Controlled hypertension was deﬁned as medicated hypertension with a measured blood pressure in the normal range. Since information on medication was only available after 1986, the prevalence of hypertension and the proportions of medicated hypertension and controlled hypertension were analyzed starting from the survey year 1986.
2.3. Correlates of Hypertension
In its guidelines, the Japanese Society of Hypertension deﬁnes the male sex, advanced age, high body mass index (BMI), not exercising, high salt intake, low vegetable and fruit intake, regularly drinking alcohol and smoking as risk factors for hypertension [16]. Job strain, deﬁned as a low control over work-related decisions and having a high workload, has also been reported as a risk factor [17,18] as has socioeconomic status [19]. Risk factors available in the NHNS were sex, age, BMI (1975–2010), salt intake (2000–2010), exercising (1986–2010, 2008 and 2009 missing), drinking alcohol (1986–2010), current smoking status (1986–2010), and occupation (1975–2010). The BMI was calculated as weight

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2018, 15, 1645

3 of 13

in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, omitting values of weight below 20 kg and of height below one meter. The BMI values of 10 to less than 70 kg/m2 were retained as these have been deﬁned elsewhere as plausible limits [20,21]. The BMI was classiﬁed following WHO guidelines: underweight was deﬁned as BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2; normal as the BMI values from 18.5 to 25 kg/m2; overweight as the BMI values over 25 kg/m2 and obese as 30 kg/m2 or more [22]. For the risk factor analysis, overweight and obese subjects were collapsed into one category of obese deﬁned as 25 kg/m2 BMI or more because Asian populations have been found to be at risk for metabolic disease at lower BMI values than Western populations [23]. In the NHNS, the dietary sodium intake is estimated retrospectively from self-reported food intake [9]. We converted sodium intake to salt intake by multiplication with a factor of 2.54 [24]. Drinking alcohol was deﬁned as regularly drinking more than one glass of Japanese sake (180 mL), one bottle of beer (500 mL), or one double whiskey (60 mL) at least four times a week [5,11]. Exercising was deﬁned as physical activity for more than 30 min at least three times a week for over one year.
Occupations were classiﬁed into primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, in line with the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication [25]. This classiﬁcation would to some extent reﬂect socioeconomic status, as the primary industries include workers in farms and ﬁsheries, the secondary industries include a large proportion of blue collar workers and the tertiary industries include the largest proportion of white-collar workers and persons with high education levels among the three industries.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with a commercially available software package (Stata14, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). We applied multivariate random effects logistic regression to assess the association of hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension, treated hypertension, and controlled hypertension with the covariates, including a random intercept term for prefecture to account for clustering within and unmeasured variations between prefectures. Graphs of the proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension by birth year for birth cohorts were smoothed using a kernel-weighted local polynomial regression smoother.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic Characteristics of the Sample
There were 554,544 observations available after the exclusion of pregnant women. After excluding 5 respondents because of anomalies between gestational age and pregnancy variables, 149,846 respondents because they were less than 20 years old, and 104,210 missing and 54 unrealistic blood pressure measurements, the ﬁnal sample consisted of 300,429 respondents sampled between 1975 and 2010. The mean age was 49.9 ± 16.2 years. Among the respondents, 124,871 were men and 175,558 women with mean ages of 49.6 ± 16.2 years and 49.4 ± 16.1 years, respectively. The mean BMI was 22.9 ± 3.3 kg/m2 for all respondents, 23.2 ± 3.1 kg/m2 for men and 22.7 ± 3.5 kg/m2 for women. The mean salt intake was 11.7 ± 4.8 g/day for all respondents, 12.7 ± 4.8 g/day for men and 11.0 ± 4.8 g/day for women. Table 1 gives an overview of the years of data availability, and the frequencies and proportions of characteristics of the sample.

Table 2 shows the prevalence of hypertension (1986–2010), the proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension (1975–2010), the proportion of hypertensive respondents receiving medication (1986–2010), and the proportion of individuals with controlled hypertension (1986—2010) among medicated respondents stratiﬁed by sex and age. The prevalence of hypertension increased with age and was higher among men than women, except for the age group of 65 and older. The proportion of hypertensive respondents seeking treatment increased with age, as did the proportion of respondents who controlled their hypertension with higher proportions of women than men for both. Men of 65 years and older were, however, equally or more successful in controlling their hypertension than women.
3.3. Risk Factors Associated with Hypertension
The means and proportions of the risk factors of age, salt intake, BMI, smoking, drinking alcohol, exercising and occupation are shown in Table 3 for one year in the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the period of analysis. Differences between men and women were seen in trends of BMI, smoking, and drinking. The proportion of women who smoke and regularly drink alcohol was still much lower in 2010 than that of men although the difference has narrowed in more recent years compared to the year 1975. Table 4 shows the odds ratios of having hypertension for each factor adjusted for all other factors. Older age was the strongest predictor (OR 42.85, 95% CI 39.93–46.00, for at least 65 compared to 20 to less than 35 years old). The strongest modiﬁable risk factor was BMI (OR 2.55, 95% CI 2.48–2.62 for obese compared to normal weight people). Salt intake and exercise showed no effect. Occupation had a weak association with hypertension.
3.4. Factors Associated with the Treatment and Control of Hypertension
Table 4 also shows the association of each risk factor with the treatment and control of hypertension adjusted for all other covariates. The odds of taking medication (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02–1.02) and the odds of controlling hypertension (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04–1.05) increased year by year. The odds of taking medication increased with age. The odds of controlling hypertension among those who sought treatment was lower for those aged 50 and older than for those younger than 50 years. Obese people had higher odds of seeking treatment than normal weight people (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99–2.14), but lower odds of controlling their hypertension (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.70–0.81). In contrast, underweight people had lower odds of seeking treatment than people of normal weight (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.53–0.64), but higher odds of controlling their hypertension (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.10–1.59).

ﬁnd evidence of an effect of salt intake on the prevalence of hypertension. One possible reason is that salt intake was estimated from self-reported food intake [8], which may not be precise enough for a quantitative analysis.
In our analysis, smoking appears to have a blood pressure lowering effect, which has also been reported elsewhere [29]. This effect has been a subject of controversy because smoking is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, which may lead to more severe forms of hypertension [29]. There is agreement that smoking is overall harmful regardless of its potential impact on blood pressure [29].
Our results show that primary industry workers are at increased risk of having hypertension. Although speciﬁc information on income or socioeconomic status was not collected in the NHNS, the classiﬁcation of occupations into industries could serve as a proxy indicator of socioeconomic status in Japan, because more people of lower education and lower socioeconomic status work in the primary and secondary industries. Similar results have been found in Western Europe where the odds of hypertension was inversely associated with the education level [30] and for the US where people of lower socioeconomic status had a higher incidence of hypertension [31].
Our analysis revealed that the prevalence of hypertension declined for men and women except for men between 50 and less than 65. The steepest declines were seen in women of 35 and older. Additionally, the prevalence of hypertension was consistently lower in women than in men of the same age except for women in the age group of 65 and older. Possible explanations for the lower prevalence of hypertension in Japanese women are that they consume less alcohol than men and have a lower BMI than men of the same age [32]. Japan has been successful in managing obesity in women, but obesity prevalence in Japanese men is still increasing [5,32]. We found that the decline in the proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension seemed to have resulted from successful control by medication. A previous report also concluded that control of hypertension by medication was the main reason for a decline of systolic blood pressure in all people, except in young women [5]. Furthermore, we found that birth cohorts of women born between 1920 and 1960 experienced a steeper decrease in the proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension than men born in the same years.
Our data suggest that the proportion of hypertensive respondents who sought treatment and of those who successfully controlled their hypertension has been increasing with time. This conﬁrmed a result from the survey “National Integrated Project for Prospective Observation of Non-communicable Disease and its Trends in the Aged” (NIPPON DATA) 1980 to 2010, a large survey that is undertaken every 10 years [6]. We found that the adjusted odds of seeking treatment were higher for older and obese respondents, alcohol consumers, workers in the primary industry and individuals who exercised. The adjusted odds of controlling hypertension were higher for underweight and younger respondents and individuals who exercised, suggesting that respondents who are more health conscious are also more likely to control their blood pressure.
In Japan, every employee is required to undergo a yearly health examination that includes blood pressure measurements [33] and every resident 40 years and older regardless of employment can receive an optional inexpensive yearly health examination that includes a blood pressure measurement [34]. Health examinations in middle age have been shown to be associated with a lower utilization of hospital beds by the elderly [34]. Although the early detection of hypertension was not speciﬁcally investigated, it may be one of the factors contributing to the lower utilization of hospital beds.
The global targets for non-communicable diseases for 2025 set by the WHO in 2011 include a reduction in the prevalence of age-standardized hypertension by 25% [1]. In 2009 it was 36.8% (95% CI 35.4–38.3%) in Japan [35] and would thus need to decrease to the level of about 28% to meet the WHO target. The Japanese Society of Hypertension recommends the following public healthcare measures to lower the systolic blood pressure of the Japanese: improved nutrition, more exercise, lower alcohol consumption for men, and seeking treatment [36]. Our results provide further evidence for these measures, in particular, that efforts should be made to ensure that men achieve the same decrease in the prevalence of hypertension as women by addressing obesity and drinking, especially targeting

middle-aged men. The prevalence of hypertension among Japanese people of 50 years and older remains high, so raising awareness for seeking treatment and controlling blood pressure should be a priority, in particular, among men.
There were limitations in this analysis. The blood pressure measurements were changed from one to two measurements in the year 2000. We used the averaged blood pressure values which may have resulted in lower blood pressure than using only the ﬁrst measurement. The NHNS contained consistent information on hypertension risk factors only for sex, age, BMI and occupation over the whole time period of 1975 to 2010. Data on hypertension medication, smoking, drinking alcohol and exercising started being collected from 1986, data on exercising were missing for the years of 2008 and 2009 and data on individual level salt intake were recorded from 2000. The participation rate of the physical NHNS examination was about 50 to 60% [9,10], which may have introduced selection bias. Randomization schemes and probability weights were not available, thus, we could not carry out a rigorous survey analysis [9,10,37]. We could not quantitatively compare our results with those of previous reports because of differences in deﬁnitions and statistical methods.
5. Conclusions
The prevalence of hypertension has been declining in Japan in adults except recently in middle-aged men. The proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension has been declining in all adults. Japanese women consume less alcohol than men and have a lower BMI than men which may partly explain the lower prevalence of hypertension in women than in men except in the oldest age group. The proportion of individuals with uncontrolled hypertension declined for cohorts born in later years in both men and women of all age groups with a steeper decline for women than men. Raising awareness for seeking treatment and controlling hypertension among the Japanese hypertensive population, in particular, those over 50 years old and lifestyle changes among men could bring Japan nearer the goal of reducing the burden of hypertension, with considerable positive health impacts in Japan’s aging population.

Aim: The objectives of the present study were to estimate the prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults, examine predictors of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension, and ascertain whether predictors varied by race.
Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out using a statewide survey of Alabama community-dwelling older adults (n = 1204). Measures of central tendency and frequency distributions were used for univariate analysis. Logistic regression was used to predict cooccurring diabetes and hypertension.
Results: The prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults was 17%. African American race (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.596–3.255), body mass index ≥30 (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.732–3.463), heart disease (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.355–2.756) and eye disease (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.018–2.024) were associated positively with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension.
Conclusions: The prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults was alarmingly high. The notable difference in the likelihood of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension is representative of a racial health disparity that largely disfavors African American older adults. Findings from the present study highlight a need for identiﬁcation of older adults who have and who are at risk of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension in the general population and in clinical settings, and the development and implementation of suitable interventions, particularly targeting older African American adults.

Introduction
According to recent estimates, the prevalence of diabetes and of hypertension among older adults in the USA is 33% and 65% respectively.1,2 Although two distinct disease states, risk factors for diabetes and hypertension are quite similar. Consequently, diabetes and hypertension are commonly associated with each other and frequently co-occur. Commonly shared risk factors include, but are not limited to, physical inactivity, obesity, unhealthy diet, heavy alcohol use and smoking; those who live in rural areas are more likely to have diabetes and hypertension compared with those who live in urban areas.3–6
Among older adults, both diabetes and hypertension are independent risk factors for frailty, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease;7–9 and co-occurring diabetes and hypertension has synergistic effects on morbidity and mortality. Co-occurring diabetes and hypertension increases all-cause mortality by 38% and cardiovascular disease by 70%.10 Furthermore, persons with co-occurrence have 3.67 higher odds of frailty.11 Hence, the accelerated pathophysiology associated with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension has been coined “an unholy alliance.12
To date, the majority of studies on older adults characterize and examine diabetes or hypertension alone, or highlight ways in which one is associated with the other,13–17 whereas only Balogun and Salako 2011 have sought to characterize and examine co-occurrence.18 However, this examination was limited to clinical and metabolic differences between hypertensive patients who developed diabetes and patients with diabetes who developed hypertension. Thus, the prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults has not been well-established, and predictors of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension have been largely unexamined. This is an important public health and clinical consideration given the adverse effects of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension on the survival and well-being of older adults. To ﬁll this knowledge gap, using a sample of community-dwelling older adults living in the state of Alabama, the present study estimated the prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults, examined predictors of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension, and ascertained whether predictors varied by race.

Methods
The present study analyzed data from an Alabama Medicaid Agency-funded long-term care needs assessment carried out by the Comprehensive Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Alabama at Birmingham known as “Charting the Course.” The purpose of Charting the Course was to assess current and emerging medical conditions and social needs of older Alabama residents. To recruit a sample representative of the state of Alabama, counties were selected based on the size of the county and geographic distribution, and it was determined a sample size of 1200 would give adequate power to detect differences by age, race, sex and area of residence. A stratiﬁed random sampling design was used to ensure that the proportion of participants would represent the state population aged >55 years.
Of residents randomly selected for participation, a letter was mailed to inform and recruit potential participants for in-home interview assessments. A toll free number was provided for persons to inquire about the study. In-home face-to-face interviews were scheduled for respondents conﬁrmed to be aged ≥55 years, able to communicate with an interviewer and living in the community.
The survey questionnaire was developed and approved by the State of Alabama Long-Term Care Task Force and the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s Comprehensive Center for Healthy Aging. Survey questions included, but were not limited to, sociodemographics, general health, health services utilization, medical history, cognitive functioning and emotional health, spirituality, social care, retirement planning, and long-term care planning. Interviewers for Charting the Course interviewed 1204 community-dwelling older adults. All participants provided signed informed consent before being interviewed. The analysis for the present study included the total sample of participants. The current study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Alabama.
Outcomes
Co-occurring diabetes and hypertension
The main outcomes were prevalence and predictors of cooccurring diabetes and hypertension. Co-occurring diabetes and hypertension was deﬁned for participants who reported having medical diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension.
Predictors
Demographics
Demographic data included sex, race (African American and white), age, education (reported in years of education), income (reported categorically as ≤$19 999, $20 000–$49 999, ≥$50 000) and residence (urban vs non-urban).
Self-rated general health and physical activity
Self-rated general health was assessed by a single-item Likert scale question that assessed overall health, “In general, how would you say your health is?”: 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = very good and 5 = excellent. Self-rated physical activity was a single-item Likert scale question that assessed physical activity, “How would you describe your level of physical activity?”: 1 = not active, 2 = minimally active, 3 = moderately active and 4 = active.
Obesity
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated using self-reported weight and height. Obesity was deﬁned as BMI ≥30.

Tobacco use
Participants who reported current cigarette use were deﬁned as
current cigarette smokers.

Medical conditions
Medical conditions included heart disease and eye disease.

Depression
Scores from the Geriatric Depression Scale (Short Form), a
15-item self-report assessment of depression, were used to identify older adults with depressive symptomatology (a score >5).19

Statistical analysis
Measures of central tendency and frequency distributions were used for univariate analysis. Student’s t-tests and the χ2-test were used to

Co-occurring diabetes and hypertension

compare numerical and dichotomous variables between those with and without co-occurring diabetes and hypertension. Logistic regression was used to determine which predictors were associated with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension. The correlations (−0.003 ≤ r ≤ 0.193) and variance inﬂation factor statistics (≥1.256) were checked during preliminary analysis. No multicollinearity problem was observed in the multivariate analysis. SPSS Statistics 23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
More than half of the sample was female (58%) and white (73%; Table 1). The average age was 69 years (range 55–90 years). Nearly half of the sample (44%) had an income of <$19 999, and the majority resided in an urban area (60%). Self-rated general health was fair (2.89, SD 1.19), and physical activity was minimally active (2.01, SD 0.97). One-third of participants were obese, and 14% smoked cigarettes. A total of 49% reported eye disease, 36% reported heart disease and 53% reported depressive symptomatology.
The prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults was 17% (Table 2). Compared with older adults without co-occurring diabetes and hypertension, a higher

proportion of older adults with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension had BMI ≥30 (χ2 = 50.96, P = 0.000), heart disease (χ2 = 46.45, P = 0.000), eye disease (χ2 = 14.33, P = 0.000) and depression (χ2 = 10.75, P = 0.001), and lower levels of self-rated general health (t = 13.26, P = 0.000) and physical activity (t = 5.17, P = 0.000). Those with and without co-occurring diabetes and hypertension did not differ in sex, age, residence or smoking status.
In the logistic regression analysis (Table 3), African American race (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.596–3.255), BMI ≥30 (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.732–3.463), heart disease (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.355–2.756), and eye disease (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.018–2.024) were associated positively with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension. Low levels of self-rated general health were associated negatively with cooccurring diabetes and hypertension (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.415–0.610).
Predictors of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension did not vary by race (Table 4). Obesity and heart problems were associated positively with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension for both African American and white participants, and low levels of self-rated general health were associated negatively with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension for both racial groups.

Discussion
Several main ﬁndings emerged from the present study. The prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension was 17%. Older adults who were African American, obese, and had heart disease or eye disease had greater odds of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension. Predictors of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension did not vary by race.
The prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults was alarmingly high. Given the multiplicative effects of co-occurrence on frailty, cardiovascular disease, renal disease and renal failure, identiﬁcation and management of older adults with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension in the general population and in clinical settings are of public health importance. Public health efforts are required to educate older adults of increased health risks associated with having both disease states, and more clinical research is needed to assist clinicians with proper management of co-occurrence.
The notable difference in the likelihood of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension is representative of a racial health disparity that largely disfavors African American older adults. If suitable interventions to prevent these diseases are not designed to target this

population, the potential is for an increase in annual incident cases of
co-occurring diabetes and hypertension-related morbidity and mortal-
ity among the growing numbers of African American older adults.
Predictors of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension did not vary
by race. Although there are no prior studies that have examined
whether predictors of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension vary by race, this ﬁnding suggests that independent risk factors for cooccurring diabetes and hypertension are not race speciﬁc. More
importantly, of the independent risk factors, obesity had the highest
odds of predictive association with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension. This ﬁnding is not surprising, given that obesity is a leading
risk factor for both diabetes and hypertension. The global prevalence of obesity has nearly doubled in the past three decades;20 in the USA, 36% of adults have a BMI ≥30,21 it is estimated nearly 90% of diabetes is attributable to excess weight22 and excess weight accounts for 65–75% of the risk for hypertension.21 This vicious synergistic
combination of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension also increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.9 Alto-
gether, this is an important issue for public health professionals to
address for the state of Alabama, because Alabama has the second highest rate for diabetes23 and the third highest rate for hypertension in the USA.24

Co-occurring diabetes and hypertension

Obesity and heart disease were risk factors across both racial groups. Health professionals and clinicians should closely monitor older adults with these conditions, and recommend strategies to prevent onset and exacerbation of both diabetes and hypertension. Physical activity as an evidence-based treatment modality for the prevention and treatment of both diabetes and hypertension has been well established.22 In addition, lifestyle changes, such as healthy dieting, and smoking and alcohol cessation, have been shown to be therapeutic for both diabetes and hypertension.25,26 Although understudied in co-occurring diabetes and hypertension populations, it is likely lifestyle changes will have similar, if not greater, therapeutic beneﬁts.
The present study had some noteworthy limitations and strengths. The limitations of this study were its cross-sectional nature; the absence of sufﬁcient data on alcohol use, anxiety and diet; and reliance on self-reported data. Given the geographic context of the study, the prevalence estimate of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension might not be generalizable to other states. Notwithstanding, the study had a relatively large number of older adults (n = 1204) and African American older adults (n = 233). The stratiﬁed random sampling strategy permitted analysis of a sample that was closely representative of community-dwelling older adults in the state of Alabama. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to estimate the prevalence of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension among older adults in the UAS, and to examine predictors of co-occurrence.
In summary, more research is required to prevent older adults with diabetes from developing hypertension, and hypertensive older adults from developing diabetes. Targeted public health screening and educational efforts can raise public awareness of risk factors and adverse outcomes associated with co-occurring diabetes and hypertension. The ﬁndings of the present study highlight a need for identiﬁcation of older adults who have and who are at risk of co-occurring diabetes and hypertension in the general population and in clinical settings, and development and implementation of suitable interventions, particularly targeting older African American adults. Based on the ﬁndings of this study, it is advisable that intervention development purposefully includes health behavior and medical approaches to negate the pathophysiological role of obesity in co-occurring diabetes and hypertension.

Metabolic syndrome in Russian adults: associated factors and mortality from cardiovascular diseases and all causes
Oleg Sidorenkov1*, Odd Nilssen1, Andrej M Grjibovski1,2,3

Abstract
Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of four major obesity-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Russia has one of the highest CVD mortality in the world, but its association with MetS remains unknown. Also little is known about factors associated with MetS and its components in Russia.
Methods: Data on 3555 adults aged 18-90 years were collected in a cross-sectional study in 2000. MetS was defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. Sex-specific associations between the IDF-defined MetS, its components, and life-style, socio-economic factors and laboratory indicators, were analysed using multivariable Poisson regression. Vital status of the study participants was identified by July 2009. Sex-specific associations between MetS and stroke, Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), CVD and all-cause death, were studied by Poisson regression adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol and history of CVDs.
Results: After adjustment for all studied factors except BMI, age, serum GGT, C-reactive protein and AST-to-ALT ratio were associated with MetS in both genders. Additionally, MetS was associated with sedentary lifestyle in women and with smoking in men. In the same regression model drinking alcohol 2-4 times a month and consumption of five or more alcohol units at one occasion in men, and drinking alcohol 5 times or more a month in women were inversely associated with MetS. After a 9-year follow-up, MetS was associated with higher risk of death from stroke (RR = 3.76, 95% CI:1.35-10.46) and from either stroke or myocardial infarction (MI, RR = 2.87, 95% CI:1.32-6.23) in men. No associations between MetS and any of the studied causes of death were observed in women.
Conclusion: Factors associated with MetS in both genders were age, GGT, C-reactive protein, and AST-to-ALT ratio. Moderate frequency of alcohol consumption and binge drinking in men and higher leisure time physical activity in women, were inversely associated with MetS. Positive associations between MetS and mortality were only observed for deaths from stroke and either stroke or MI in men.

Background The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of four major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors; obesity, insulin resistance (hyperglycemia), arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia where obesity and insulin resistance are the core elements [1]. Other important characteristics of MetS include low-grade inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, plasma hypercoagulability and atherosclerosis [2].

MetS is associated with increased CVD and all-cause mortality [3,4]. Moreover, it may be used as an alternative to the classic coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment scale such as the Framingham Risk Score [5]. The prevalence of MetS varies greatly between countries and ethnic groups [6]. Among Europeans and white Americans it varies between 20% and 30% with similar gender distribution [7,8]. Due to its high prevalence, MetS is considered as the major public health problem in Europe, and, particularly in the USA, where obesity and overweight are the second leading cause of preventable death accounting for 300.000 deaths per year [9].

The prevalence of MetS is associated with life-style, demographic, socio-economic, and genetic factors. Age, body mass index, postmenopausal status, diet rich in saturated fats, carbohydrates, and smoking have been positively associated with MetS, while inverse associations have been shown for physical activity, education, income, and alcohol intake [7,10-12].
Cardiovascular mortality in Russia is about four times higher than in Western Europe and the gap is the largest among middle aged men [13]. Although there is evidence for a high contribution of hazardous level of alcohol consumption to high death rates in Russia [14-16], other factors also need to be investigated. As MetS represents a cluster of the four of six major cardiovascular risk factors strongly associated with CVD mortality, one might expect similar high rates of MetS or its components in Russia.
Despite the fact that determinants of MetS and its contribution to mortality in Europe and North America receive much attention by the research community, it remains one of the least studied factors in Russia. In an earlier study we showed that while the prevalence of MetS among Russian women in 2000 was comparable with findings from other European countries, among men it was a half of that [17].
The aim of this study was to further explore the data collected in 2000 by studying socio-demographic and lifestyle correlates of MetS and associations between the MetS and CVD-and all-cause mortality after 9 years of follow-up.
Methods
Study sample The data were obtained from a cross-sectional population-based study conducted in 2000 in Arkhangelsk, Northwest Russia. Detailed information on study design, sampling procedure and data collection is presented elsewhere [17-19]. In brief, we invited 3745 subjects aged ≥18 years from the patient register at the Semashko outpatient clinic in Arkhangelsk. Most of the participants were consecutively recruited when they came for their obligatory annual medical examinations. Others, particularly pensioners from the area served by the Semashko clinic, were specifically invited to participate in this study. Only 40 individuals refused to participate (response rate 98.9%).
Data collection Data on education, occupational status, use of medications, history of myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus, and stroke as well as typical patterns of leisure time physical activity, smoking, frequency and amount of alcohol consumption, frequency of fresh fruits and vegetables intake with no specified time-frames were

collected using a 6-page comprehensive questionnaire. Blood pressure (BP) was measured three times. The average of the two last readings was used in the study. Waist circumference (WC) was measured at the umbilical level. Weight and height were measured with subjects in light clothing and without shoes. Venous blood samples were drawn and centrifuged within 15-25 min. Most of the participants fasted prior to testing.
Laboratory analyses Enzymatic colorimetric tests were used to measure TC (cholesterol esterase, cholesterol oxidase) and TG (lipoprotein lipase, glycerokinase, and glycerophosphate oxidase). HDL-C was measured by a homogenous enzymatic colorimetric test (PEG cholesterol esterase, and PEG peroxidase). All biochemical analyses of serum lipids were performed using a Hitachi 737 analyzer. Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was measured by an enzymatic colorimetric test (standardized method, Roche). Aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) and alaninaminotransferase (ALT) were measured photometrically by Hitachi 917 analyzer. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay in a Roche Modular P analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, D-68298 Mannheim). Glycated hemoglobin (HBA1c), which reflects the mean glucose level over the preceding 2-3 months, was assessed by Bio-Rad Variant II HPLC system with reagents from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Inc., Hercules, CA 94547, USA).
The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation for all laboratory tests were under 3%.
Definition of the metabolic syndrome MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) [6] and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) [20]criteria. We applied cutoffs for WC as it was recommended for europids (men ≥94 cm, women ≥80 cm) and (men ≥102 cm, women ≥88 cm), respectively, for IDF and NCEP. We used HBA1c as the measurement of hyperglycemia (defined as HBA1c ≥6.1%, and/or self-reported diabetes, and/or receiving treatment for diabetes).
Description of the variables Education was divided into 3 categories: low (primary or secondary school), average (vocational school or incomplete university education) and high (complete university education). As income level was difficult to determine due to high inflation and collapsing economy due to the crisis and default in 1998-99, we used data on selfreported occupational status as a “surrogate” measure for income. Income level was defined according to official data on average salary levels in different sectors of the economy for year 2000 [21]. Five categories were

generated: very low, low, medium, high and unknown. Occasional and daily smokers comprised the group of smokers, while non-smokers and ex-smokers comprised the non-smoking group. Leisure-time physical activity was dichotomized as “inactive” or “sedentary lifestyle” (predominantly sitting activity like reading, watching TV) and “active” (walking or bicycling or yard working at least 4 hours per week, regular training and professional sport). Intake of fresh fruits or vegetables was dichotomized as “low” (once a week or less) and “high” (2 times a week or more). Alcohol consumption was presented by two variables: frequency of alcohol intake, and number of alcohol units (AU) consumed on one occasion. One AU was equal to 13.8 g of pure alcohol. The frequency of alcohol consumption was divided into 4 groups: abstainers, ≤1 times a month, 2-4 times a month, ≥5 times a month. The number of AU consumed at one drinking session was divided into 3 categories: abstainers, 1-4 AU and ≥5 AU (later referred to as binge drinking). Normal weight, overweight and obesity were defined as a BMI <25, 25-29.9, and ≥30 kg/m2, respectively. As the distribution of the liver enzymes and CRP was right-skewed, we used logarithmically transformed values in the regression models.
Altogether 150 individuals had missing data on one or more variables and were excluded from the analyses. The final sample consisted of 3555 individuals (1918 men and 1637 women) aged 18-90 years or 96% of the initial sample.
Statistical analyses Differences in the distribution of the studied characteristics between genders were studied by Pearson’s chisquared tests and unpaired t-tests for categorical and continuous data, respectively. Gender-specific associations between MetS defined by the IDF criteria, its individual components and socio-demographic, lifestyle and metabolic factors were calculated using Poisson regression with robust variance estimates as recommended by Barros and Hirakata [22], and are presented as crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Follow-up study In July 2009 we collected data on the vital status of all study participants, using the mortality register of the Arkhangelsk Regional Healthcare Department which is based on data from medical death certificates. Causes of death were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The study endpoints were: death from coronary heart disease (CHD) (I20-25); death from stroke (I60-64); death from either myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke (I21-23; I60-64); CVD death (I00-99); and all-cause death. By July 2009,

200 subjects of the 3555 participants had died and in 97 of the cases (48%) the diagnosis was verified by autopsy. To study associations between MetS in 2000 and mortality by 2009, we used both IDF and NCEP definitions of MetS to increase comparability of the findings with other studies. Gender-specific risk ratios (RR) were calculated by Poisson regression.
All analyses were performed using STATA 10 (STATA Corp, TX, USA). The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee in Norway.
Results
Sample characteristics Participants’ background characteristics and the prevalence of MetS are presented in Table 1. Men were younger, had higher income, but lower education than women. They were more physically active, smoked more, drank alcohol more often and had higher levels of alcohol intake at one drinking session. About 50% of the men reported binge drinking, by contrast to 15% among women. Vodka/liquor constituted about 66% and 45% of the total consumption in men and women, respectively (data not shown). Men also had higher levels of liver enzymes and CRP. The prevalence of MetS in men was half of that in women (Table 1).
Correlates of the metabolic syndrome Among men, MetS was positively associated with age, BMI, sedentary lifestyle, GGT and CRP; and inversely associated with income, smoking, frequency and amount of alcohol intake as well as the AST-to-ALT ratio in the crude analysis. After adjustment for all studied factors except BMI, the associations between MetS and income disappeared. Additional adjustment for BMI attenuated most of the associations except the positive association with age, and inverse associations with the AST-to-ALT ratio, frequency and amount of alcohol consumption (Table 2).
In women, MetS was positively associated with BMI, age, very low income, sedentary lifestyle, GGT and CRP, and inversely associated with education, unknown income category, smoking, frequency and amount of alcohol consumption as well as AST-to-ALT ratio in crude analysis. After adjustment for all study factors except BMI, the associations between MetS and income, education, smoking and alcohol disappeared. After further adjustment for BMI, only age, sedentary lifestyle, GGT and CRP remained associated with MetS.
Correlates of the individual metabolic components In the multivariable analysis of the MetS components (Table 3), frequency and volume of alcohol intake were inversely associated with prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (high-TG), low levels of high density lipoproteins (low-HDL-C) and hyperglycemia in men.

results were found for frequency of alcohol consumption in women. The volume of consumed alcohol increased HDL-C levels, but showed weaker association in women than in men. Current smoking in men and sedentary lifestyle in women, were related to unfavorable lipid status. It was associated with 40% lower

rates of central adiposity in men, as compared to nonsmokers.
Serum levels of GGT and CRP in women were positively related to all five metabolic components (Table 3). High serum levels of GGT were the strongest metabolic marker in men, in whom it was related to increased prevalence of

hypertriglyceridemia, central obesity and hypertension. The AST-to-ALT ratio was inversely associated with hypertriglyceridemia and central obesity in both genders, although the strength of association was larger in men.
Metabolic syndrome and mortality MetS as defined by the IDF criteria was associated with more than 6 times higher risk of death from stroke among men after 9 years of observation in (Table 4, Model 1). Adjustment for age, history of CVD, smoking

and alcohol attenuated the association, but the risk of death from stroke was still more than 3 times higher for men with MetS. Death from either stroke or myocardial infarction occurred twice as common among the men with IDF-defined MetS (Model 3). In women, the association between MetS and death from the former causes was much less pronounced (Model 1) and disappeared after adjustment for other covariates.
The risk of cardiovascular death was almost 2.5 times higher both in men and women with MetS (Table 4,

Model 1). However, in both genders these associations disappeared after adjustment for age, and reduced even further after adjustment for other factors. Similar associations were found between all-cause death and MetS in crude analysis, but were attenuated after adjustment for age. The adjusted risk ratio for women was about 40% higher, but did not reach the level of statistical significance (Model 3). No consistent associations between CHD death and MetS were found. Associations between mortality and MetS defined by the NCEP criteria were in the same direction.
Discussion To the best of our knowledge this is the first study in Russia on determinants of MetS and its association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The main findings suggest that frequency of alcohol consumption and amount of alcohol consumed at one drinking episode are important correlates of MetS in Northwest Russia. Age, sedentary lifestyle and liver enzymes were also associated with MetS independently of all other studied factors. Moreover, MetS was associated with increased risk of death from stroke and either stroke or myocardial

infarction among men during the 9-year observation period. The study discloses sex-specific adjusted relationships between frequency and volume of alcohol consumption in Russia (where these factors are considered to be very important correlates [15,16,23] of cardiovascular death) and all other major cardiovascular risk factors (except smoking) taken both individually and in frames of the MetS concept. GGT, AST, ALT and, particularly, C-reactive protein and AST-to-ALT ratio were associated with MetS and its individual components as expected from the current knowledge [2,24-27].
However, the results should be interpreted cautiously taking into account several limitations of the study. Unemployed and marginalized subjects are likely to be underrepresented. There were 150 participants with missing data on one or several characteristics, although, they did not differ systematically from those included in the analyses by characteristics for which the data were available. Application of modified IDF and NCEP criteria where we used HBA1c serum levels instead of plasma glucose could result in some underestimation of the prevalence of MetS, since the HBA1c is less sensitive. Other limitations related to study design including

glycemia measurement have been discussed in details elsewhere [17-19]. Given that diabetes is a risk factor for CVD, the sample was re-analyzed without those who reported diabetes in 2000, but the results were virtually identical.
During the 9-year follow-up we were not able to differentiate those who died in other regions and those who migrated, but did not die. This problem can be attributed to virtually all large Russian longitudinal studies, since there is no national population and mortality registers available for medical research. As a result, the participants, who moved from the Arkhangelsk region during the period of observation, could not be traced and those who died outside the region couldn’t be registered. The approximate estimates of loss due to migration during the 9-year period is estimated to be between 15 and 17.5% [28]. Young people (≤30 years) were more likely to migrate to other regions, presumably looking for better work or education. Cardiovascular mortality in this age-group was lowest, compared to the other age-groups, and deaths from external causes accounted for more than 75%. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this loss to follow-up strikingly affected the observed associations between MetS and CVD mortality.
Both frequency of alcohol drinking and amount of alcohol consumed on one occasion were inversely associated with MetS, particularly among men. Interestingly, the crude association between the amount of alcohol consumed on one occasion and MetS was similar for men and women. However, after adjustment, the association persisted only among men. This association seems to be mediated by favorable changes in the lipid profile, but also by improvements in insulin action and lower risk for hyperglycemia (Table 3). A consumption of five or more AU on occasion (about ≥75 g of ethanol) was independently related to 50% lower prevalence of MetS (Table 2, Model 3), and, respectively, 25, 20 and 50% lower prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, low-HDLC levels and hyperglycemia (Table 3) among men.
Moderate alcohol consumption is known to increase serum triglycerides level, mainly because of alcohol-stimulated lipolysis [29]. There is evidence that a large part of this TG increase is mediated by contemporary fat consumption [30]. In western communities alcohol intake is often moderate and followed by affluent ingestion of foods, rich in polyunsaturated fats, whereas Russian men still widely combine a pattern of vodka binge drinking with low food intake [15,31]. These cultural peculiarities may explain the decrease of the TG level in response to higher amounts of alcohol consumed among Russian men. Taking into account that more than 50% of men in the study sample reported that they drink at least 5 AU (about one 200 ml glass of vodka) on occasion, and two thirds reported intake of mainly vodka at least two times

a month (much the same findings were reported in other studies [32,33] from Russia), we consider that the lifestyle associated with such a pattern of alcohol intake plays an important role in metabolic risk reduction among Russian men. Thus, gender-specific pattern of alcohol intake and the type of alcohol consumed (high single occasion consumption of strong alcohol by men) together with a confirmed effect of alcohol on serum lipids and insulin resistance might at least partly explain lower rates of MetS among men. It is also possible that this mechanism might also explain the lower metabolic risk in Russian men compared to their Western counterparts. Higher metabolic risk among subjects who abstained from alcohol relative to moderate drinkers, has also been described in longitudinal [34] and cross-sectional [10,35,36] studies. Our results are in line with these findings, suggesting that the pattern of alcohol consumption we found, improves the lipid spectrum by increasing the HDL-C concentration and lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Similar results were obtained in another study from Russia where the levels of HDL-C and LDL-C were, respectively, directly and inversely associated with alcohol consumption[37]. Our finding that a consumption of ≥5 AU on occasion is associated with improved glycemic profile, possibly, due to reduction of the insulin resistance, agrees also well with the existing knowledge [29,38].
Low education and low income has been consistently associated with MetS in the US [7,34]. In our study we found no clear effect of these factors. In crude analysis we found slightly lower prevalence of MetS in women with university education and in men with high income. This association disappeared after adjustment. This discrepancy with the findings from other countries may be due to the fact that in Russia the distribution of health outcomes is less strongly linked to socio-economic status compared to the US or the UK. Higher education in Russia does not guarantee high socio-economic status. Moreover, subjects included in the high income category were relatively poor by international standards with an average monthly salary of about 500 USD.
Several studies have reported sedentary life-style as a risk factor for MetS [7,11,12]. We also observed that low leisure-time physical activity was associated with higher prevalence of MetS in both genders, independently of other studied factors.
We observed an inverse association between smoking and MetS (crude analysis), but this association disappeared after adjustment. However, smoking was positively associated with dyslipidemia in both genders and inversely with central adiposity in men. These findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that nicotine increases the energy expenditure, reduces the appetite and stimulates the lipolysis, thus decreasing the

risk for obesity [39]. On the other hand, smoking negatively affects the coronary heart system through elevation of blood pressure and development of arteriosclerosis.
Increased serum levels of GGT, CRP and low AST-toALT ratio turned out to be independently associated with high metabolic risk, similarly to what has been observed in previous research[2,24-26]. The association of GGT and CRP with MetS was stronger in women, whereas the effect of AST-to-ALT ratio was more pronounced in men (Model 3, Table 2). Several studies have reported that both GGT and CRP synergistically increase with the risk of both metabolic syndrome and obesity as well as with a high alcohol intake [24,25,40]. The pattern of association of the AST-to-ALT ratio is totally different; the ratio tends to be lower (often ≤1) in obese and subjects with the MetS, and higher (often ≥2) in those with high alcohol consumption [27]. One possible explanation of this gender difference is that the association of BMI with MetS in men was much stronger. Another explanation is that the adjusted effects of ASTto-ALT ratio constitute a proxy of the protective action of alcohol which was not fully reflected by self-report [19]. This effect is not evident for GGT and CRP since they are synergistically related to both MetS and alcohol consumption, but it is apparent for the AST-to-ALT ratio (antagonistic association). This suggests that the gender-dependent strength of association for GGT and CRP levels and the AST-to-ALT ratio with MetS and its individual components underlines the protective effect of alcohol intake on MetS we found in our study.
MetS was associated with an increased risk of stroke-, either stroke or MI-, CVD-and all-cause death during the 9 year follow-up. After adjustment for age and other potential confounders, the risk was still more than 3 times higher for a fatal stroke and more than 2 times higher for death from either stroke or MI among men with MetS. The lack of significant associations between MetS and, CVD-, and, particularly, CHD-death in the adjusted analyses, might be due to heterogeneity of these diagnostic groups. The CHD, for example, included not only diagnoses of fatal myocardial infarction (I21-23) which are clinically well-distinguishable, characterized by progressing atherosclerosis and pathogenetically close to relatively homogenous and clinically well-defined group of cerebral strokes (I60-I64), but also such vaguely defined conditions as “other forms of acute or sub-acute ischemia” (I24) and “chronic ischemic heart disease” (I25). The latest evidences from Russia suggest that alcohol is an important factor implicated in the pathophysiology of the former two causes of death, and that some deaths within these subgroups are actually caused by acute alcohol intoxication[16] or alcoholic cardiomyopathy due to chronic toxic effects of alcohol on the myocardium[41,42]. We suggest that these CHD-

subcategories should be included in future longitudinal analyses as separate end-points. However, it will require more statistical power which we lacked in the study. We also emphasize the need for larger population-based studies from Russia to either replicate or refute our results.
Thus, as a cluster of four major CVD risk predictors, MetS represents one of the factors contributing to the high cardiovascular mortality in Russia, but it is unlikely that it plays a central role at present. Following the improvements of living conditions during the last decade, the latest state’s anti-alcohol initiatives launched in 2006, and the recent increase in life-expectancy [43], the prevalence of MetS is likely to increase in the nearest future, thereby enhancing the proportion of MetSmediated cardiovascular and all-cause deaths in Russia.
Conclusion Age, GGT and C-reactive protein, and AST-to-ALT ratio were associated with MetS in both men and women. High leisure time physical activity in women and moderate frequency of alcohol consumption and binge drinking in men were inversely associated with MetS. Differences between men and women in alcohol consumption may explain gender variation in the MetS prevalence. MetS increased the risk of death from stroke and from either myocardial infarction or stroke during the 9-year follow-up period in men while no associations with mortality were found in women.

Gamma-Glutamyltransferase, Atherosclerosis, and Cardiovascular Disease
Triggering Oxidative Stress Within the Plaque
Michele Emdin, MD, PhD; Alfonso Pompella, MD, PhD; Aldo Paolicchi, MD, PhD

The serum determination of gamma-glutamyltransferase (␥-GT) activity is a low-cost, highly sensitive and accurate, and frequently used laboratory test. Although it is considered to be an index of hepatobiliary dysfunction and alcohol abuse,1 recent epidemiology and pathology studies have suggested its independent role in the pathogenesis and clinical evolution of cardiovascular diseases brought on by atherosclerosis.1,2
Article p 2130
The prospective study by Ruttman and colleagues in 163 944 Austrian adults studied for 17 years shows that ␥-GT is independently associated with cardiovascular mortality.3 Serum ␥-GT activity had a prognostic impact on fatal events of chronic forms of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. This was found to be true in both sexes, with a clear dose-response relationship, and with a stronger prognostic significance of ␥-GT in younger participants.
These findings from a large unselected cohort unequivocally confirm previous observations that ␥-GT is associated with overall mortality and cardiovascular events, in both unselected populations4–7 and patients with ascertained coronary artery disease, independent of all confounders including liver function and alcohol use.8,9
Well-Known Versus “Unknown” ␥-Glutamyltransferase
␥-GT is the enzyme responsible for the extracellular catabolism of glutathione (GSH, ␥-glutamyl-cisteinyl-glycine), the main thiol intracellular antioxidant agent in mammalian cells.1 It is present, linked through a small lipophilic sequence of its larger subunit, on the cell surface membrane of most cell types; although the same protein is produced in all tissues, differences in the sugar moieties allow that only the liver ␥-GT is detectable in serum.10 Most serum ␥-GT is bound to carriers, such as ␣- and ␤-lipoproteins and albumin.1

This association is likely to occur within hepatocytes, before ␥-GT releases in serum, through still-unknown mechanisms.
Serum ␥-GT activity is affected by genetic and environmental factors, with heritability estimated at 0.52.11 Within its normal range, it has many other determinants, even stronger than liver function or alcohol consumption.1 The findings of the Austrian Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Program,3 a large unselected Norwegian population,12 and a prospective study of 7613 middle-age British men6 show a strong positive association between serum ␥-GT level and body mass index, alcohol use, smoking, total lipoprotein and HDL, serum cholesterol, uric acid, serum triglycerides, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, preexisting ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and blood glucose use of oral contraceptives and menopause; pregnant women had lower values.3,5,6,12 ␥-GT showed a negative association in men in regard to physical activity and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) and coffee consumption.3,5,6
Prooxidant Effects of Glutathione Hydrolysis by ␥-Glutamyltransferase
Catalytically active ␥-GT has been found within atherosclerotic cerebral, carotid, and coronary plaques from autoptic studies and surgical endoarterectomy, colocalized with oxidized density lipoproteins (LDL) and CD68ϩ foam cells.13–15 As concerns the possible association between ␥-GT and inflammatory process, it should also be considered that ␥-GT has a key role in the interconversion of the glutathionecontaining inflammatory mediator leukotriene C4 into leukotriene D4.16
Although the exact mechanism leading to accumulation of ␥-GT within the plaque is unknown, the association of ␥-GT to lipoproteins suggests that LDL lipoproteins can carry ␥-GT activity inside the plaque,17 where free iron is also present.18 In the extracellular milieu, ␥-GT is the only enzyme responsible for GSH catabolism by hydrolysis of its ␥-glutamyl bond between glutamate and cysteine. This reaction produces cysteinyl-glycine moieties, which are usually taken within intracellular milieu by the action of membrane dipeptidases, as precursors for GSH resynthesis.1
Cysteinyl-glycine is a powerful reducer of Fe3ϩ in the extracellular milieu—and likely at the plaque level—that is able to simultaneously generate Fe2ϩ and a free thiyl radical; subsequent reactions lead to the formation of superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide.2 These ␥-GT-mediated reactions have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of LDL lipoproteins,13 likely contributing to oxidative events influ-

Histochemical reaction for ␥-GT enzyme activity was performed with the speciﬁc substrate ␥-glutamyl-4-methoxy-2naphtylamide and the diazonium salt Fast Garnet GBC as a chromogen.

encing plaque evolution and rupture (Figure, A and B). Because of the iron dependence of ␥-GT mediated reactions, the described association between increased body iron stores and excess risk of acute myocardial infarction suggests that iron metabolism could influence the predictive value of serum ␥-GT.19 The oxidative stress mediated by ␥-GT could thus play a relevant role in the evolution of atherosclerotic plaque and its instabilization: apoptosis of cellular elements of the lesion, plaque erosion and rupture, enhanced platelet aggregation, and thrombosis.20
␥-GT from Bench to Bedside
Ruttmann and colleagues established the prognostic value of ␥-GT for cardiovascular events at serum levels that lie within

normal values. The receiver operating characteristics analysis suggested ␥-GT cutoff values of 15.5 U/L for men and 10.5 U/L for women, corresponding to 27.6 U/L and 18.7 U/L, respectively, for measurements made at 37°C.3 An increasing number of population studies have evaluated the relationship between serum ␥-GT activity and mortality, since the observation of Conigrave et al in 19934 that indicated the predictive value of ␥-GT for mortality, irrespective of hepatic disease or alcohol consumption.
Thereafter, Wannameethe confirmed the negative prognostic value of ␥-GT6: After adjustment for all confounders, elevated ␥-GT (highest quintile Ն24 U/L versus the rest) was associated with a significant increase in mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease, namely in individuals with a history of ischemic heart disease. This suggested a link with underlying atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Another more recent study aimed at evaluating the long-term prognosis among 714 patients with a small or unconfirmed acute myocardial infarction indicated ␥-GT as an independent risk factor for death in association with age, previous myocardial infarction, smoking, and glucose.9
The link with underlying atherosclerotic coronary artery disease has been demonstrated by a prospective study of our group. During a 6-year follow-up of 469 patients with ischemic syndrome and angiographically documented coronary artery disease,8 and after correcting for other cardiovascular risk factors (eg, age, smoking habit, serum cholesterol, left ventricular ejection fraction, body mass index, diabetes mellitus) or confounding factors, such as serum alanineaminotransferase level and self-reported alcohol consumption, the prognostic value of serum ␥-GT activity for cardiac death and nonfatal infarction has been confirmed in a subset of patients corresponding to 36% of the whole population, characterized by the association of multivessel disease and history of myocardial infarction. The risk increased with different cutoff values of 25 and 40 U/L, however, within the normal range, and the event excess was concentrated within the first 3-year period.8 The prognostic significance of ␥-GT seems thus correlated not only with the extent of coronary artery disease but also with the instability of the plaque.
As concerns stroke mortality, the finding by Ruttmann’s group confirm earlier reports from a large Finnish study in unselected populations in both sexes, which demonstrated that ␥-GT is associated with an independent prognostic value for ischemic stroke, independent of self-reported alcohol consumption, whereas another common marker of alcohol consumption, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, was inversely associated with risk.3,7
Ruttmann’s group does not report any information about the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. This makes it impossible to understand whether the prognostic role of ␥-GT is associated either with evolution or final complications of the atherosclerotic process.3 History of previous ischemic heart disease, in particular of previous myocardial infarction, regardless of ventricular function, strengthened ␥-GT predictive value, indicating that considering coronary patients as a whole, those with higher ␥-GT activity may constitute a subset at highest risk of repetitive events.4,8 The extent of coronary atherosclerotic disease enhances the ␥-GT prognos-

tic significance, which may act on a larger substratum.8 Interestingly, both percutaneous and surgical revascularization were able to abolish the ␥-GT prognostic value, confirming its intrinsic link with the evolution of the plaque.8
The pathogenetic mechanism proposed for the role of ␥-GT in promoting the atherosclerotic process should be considered independent, complementary, and synergistic to conventional determinants. In fact, level of serum ␥-GT is significantly genetically determined;6 serum ␥-GT activity holds an independent prognostic value within reference level range in all epidemiological studies after adjustment for confounders such as indicators of hepatic function and alcohol consumption (the latter has often been found to exert a rather protective effect);3–8,13 ␥-GT maintains its predictive value after adjustment for other established cardiovascular risk factors, which, however, affect at least in part its concentration, such as obesity, smoking, total serum cholesterol, arterial hypertension, diabetes, reduced physical activity, with particular emphasis in patients with history of preexisting ischemic heart disease.3–8,13
Do We Need Another Risk Factor?
In conclusion, the recent insights into the role of thiol methabolism in atherosclerosis not only increase our understanding of the disease but also have practical clinical applications in risk stratification and targeting of therapy for a clinical challenge of growing worldwide importance. Elevation in serum ␥-GT activity predicts outcomes in unselected populations and in patients with ascertained ischemic heart disease, independently of myocardial damage, thus adding to prognostic information provided by traditional risk factors.
As for ischemic cerebral and heart disease, ␥-GT serum assay seems to have all of the main features of a true prognostic marker: the diagnostic assay has optimal sensitivity-specificity,1,2 epidemiological evidence of its presence before the event in apparently healthy people and patients with clinical overt disease increases our ability to predict it,3,5–9,13 it has additive and independent predictive value in comparison with established risk factors.3,5–9 Finally, as concerns ischemic heart disease, the prognostic impact of ␥-GT can be abolished by therapeutic interventions, such as coronary revascularization.8
The physiological function of ␥-GT enzyme activity as a source of peptide precursors for intracellular GSH resynthesis, as well as the current clinical concept of its serum activity as the consequence of a compensatory overexpression in response to hepatobiliary dysfunction or alcohol toxic effect, is challenged. The evidence is growing in favor of a detrimental role, triggering a prooxidant action within the atherosclerotic plaque. Additional investigation would permit the identification among subjects with higher ␥-GT value those with a higher risk of developing clinical disease, allowing definition of the interrelationships with iron metabolism alterations, markers of inflammatory process, of glucose and metabolic disease, and with presence, features, and extent of atherosclerotic vessel disease, to better define the most risky combination for the vulnerable plaque and the best medical

strategies for the stabilization of lesions, rather than percutaneous or surgical procedures.

Body Fat Distribution, Liver Enzymes, and Risk of Hypertension
Evidence From the Western New York Study

Abstract—␥-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) has been associated with hypertension (HTN); however, the nature of this association remains unclear. GGT is a marker of alcohol consumption, but it is also related to the infiltration of fat in the liver (fatty liver). The association between GGT and HTN was examined in a 6-year longitudinal investigation among 1455 men and women who returned for the follow-up visit. Baseline variables included serum GGT, blood pressure, and anthropometric measures. Incident HTN was defined as blood pressure Ն140/90 or on antihypertensive medication at the follow-up visit. To eliminate individuals with potential liver pathology, analyses focused only on individuals with GGT within its normal range (nϭ897). Participants were divided in quintiles (Q) based on their baseline GGT levels. Multiple logistic regression analyses [odds ratio (95% confidence intervals)] revealed a significant association of GGT with incident hypertension [2.1 (1.1 to 4.0) Q5 versus Q1]. In subgroup analyses, GGT and HTN were significantly associated among both noncurrent and current drinkers, but only for participants above the median of anthropometric measures [eg, body mass index Ͼ26.4, 2.3 (0.9 to 5.7), waist circumference Ͼ86.1 cm, 3.7 (1.4 to 9.9), and abdominal height Ͼ19.8 cm, 3.1 (1.2 to 8.5), for Q5 versus Q1, in fully adjusted models]. These findings suggest that the association between GGT and hypertension is not caused solely by alcohol consumption and indicate that serum GGT, within its normal range, may predict hypertension among individuals with increased central fat distribution, suggesting that fatty liver may represent an important underlying mechanism for this association.

R ecent epidemiologic and clinical studies have reported a strong association between ␥-glutamyltransferase (GGT), a commonly used biochemical liver test, and several cardiovascular risk factors and diseases including hypertension.1–15 The mechanism underlying this association is still not well understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether these observations are not confounded by use of alcohol or obesity, especially central (visceral) fat, and may reflect an underlying condition, such as hepatic insulin resistance or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). It is known that GGT has a protective function in maintaining appropriate hepatic glutathione levels, which are crucial in antioxidant defenses.16 In addition, GGT has been widely used as a biological marker of alcohol consumption.17,18 Recent findings have shown as well that regional body fat distribution, with abdominal accumulation, may represent a stronger predictor of elevated liver enzymes including GGT than relative weight, as assessed by body mass index (BMI).19,20 Furthermore, central adiposity can be an independent predictor of NAFL.21–23 This common clinical and histological condition has been recently related to insulin

resistance and has been suggested as an additional feature of the metabolic syndrome.24–26 There is evidence that both fatty liver and central obesity are associated with free radical generation thus enhancing oxidative stress.16,27,28 Therefore, it is possible that NAFL may represent the link in the association of GGT with hypertension and other components of the metabolic syndrome.
We examined this question in a 6-year longitudinal investigation of the Western New York Study, a population-based study of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors among residents of Erie and Niagara Counties, New York.

Finance Administration lists. Eligible participants for the current study were men and women aged 39 to 79 years selected from the baseline examination without known clinical cardiovascular disease (self-report) or type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose Ͼ125 mg/dL or self-report) and who were capable of completing the current study protocol (nϭ2652). Exclusion criteria included self-report of any medical condition that would prohibit participation (eg, all cancers except skin cancer, type 1 diabetes, physical or mental impairment, permanent change in residence out-of-state, deceased, or inability to contact and determine eligibility). This left 2139 persons eligible, of whom 1455 completed the full clinic examination (68.0%) at the follow-up visit (6.0 years Ϯ0.8). Participants with prevalent hypertension (blood pressure Ն140/90 or on antihypertensive treatment) at baseline were further excluded (nϭ448). Finally, to eliminate individuals with potential liver pathology, we excluded 110 individuals with GGT values above the normal reference range of the laboratory (5 to 55 U/L). The remaining 897 participants are included in this analysis.
The protocol was approved by the University at Buffalo Health Science institutional review board and all participants provided written informed consent before participation.
Compared with those who refused, participants in the current report were less likely to be smokers at the baseline and somewhat more educated (14.4 years versus 13.1 years of formal education; PϽ0.001). There were no significant differences in race, sex ratio, BMI, fasting glucose concentration or blood pressure values between participants and refusers.

Study Protocol
All participants received a clinical examination that included resting blood pressure, measures of height, weight, waist circumference, and abdominal height. In addition, several questionnaires that were first administered at the baseline examination were re-administered. These assessed lifestyle and health habit information including: cigarette use, physical activity, alcohol use, general health and well-being, personal and family health history, medication use, and socioeconomic status.
Anthropometric measurements were determined by trained and certified interviewers on participants who wore light clothing and no shoes. Waist circumference was determined with participants standing erect with the abdomen relaxed, arms at the side, and feet together. The tape was horizontally placed between the bottom of the rib cage and the top of the iliac crest (hip bones) around the smallest circumference between these 2 reference points. The measurement was taken at the end of a normal expiration, without the tape compressing the skin, to the nearest 0.1 cm. Abdominal height was measured using the Holtain-Kahn abdominal caliper.30 Three separate measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 cm of the sagittal (eg, antero-posterior) abdominal diameter. If the 3 readings were not within 0.5 cm of each other, the 3 readings were repeated until they were all within 0.5 cm of each other. The mean of the 3 readings were used in these analyses. During the study we examined the intraand inter-observer variability of the abdominal height measurement. The intra-observer variability, evaluated by the intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient, was 0.99. The inter-observer variability was

0.99. Both waist circumference and abdominal height have been shown to be highly correlated with the volume of visceral fat as determined by multi-scan tomography.31–33 Height was measured on a permanently mounted vertical board (Perspective Enterprises, Kalamazoo, Mich), according to a standardized protocol. Weight was measured to the nearest tenth of a pound on a calibrated balance beam scale (Detecto, Inc, Webb City, Mo). BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height in meters2.
At both examinations, blood pressure was measured 3 times using a standard mercury manometer by trained and certified technicians. The onset of the first phase (systolic) and fifth phase (diastolic) Korotkoff sounds were recorded. The mean of the second and third measures were used in the analyses. At both examinations, hypertension was defined as blood pressure Ն140/90 or use of antihypertensive medications.34
At the baseline, a blood sample was obtained for determination of routine chemistry between 7:30 and 9:30 AM after a fasting for 8 to 12 hours. Immediately after phlebotomy, tubes were wrapped in aluminum foil to protect them from light and kept at room temperature for 30 minutes and allowed to clot. Blood tubes were centrifuged at 3000g for 10 minutes and 1.5 mL of serum was transferred to polypropylene screw cap vials and placed in a cooler with a cold pack. Samples were delivered by courier to Millard Fillmore Center for Laboratory Medicine (Amherst, NY) for analysis the same day. Hepatic enzymes alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum ␥-glutamyl transferase (SGGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured by kinetic enzyme assays as part of a chemistry profile on a Paramax Automated Chemistry System.35,36
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS-12.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Differences in baseline characteristics between participants who remained normotensive and those who became hypertensive at the follow-up visit were evaluated using independent sample t tests for continuous variables and ␹2 test for categorical variables. Participants were divided into quintiles (Q) of GGT concentration according to the baseline distribution. Differences in baseline characteristics were also evaluated across GGT quintiles. Tests for interaction between GGT and gender were not significant; therefore, all analyses were conducted without stratifying for gender.
Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of incident hypertension across

baseline GGT quintiles. The lowest quintile was used as the reference category. Covariates included: the baseline values of age, gender, race, average amount of alcohol, smoking status, BMI, physical activity, and systolic blood pressure. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the association between GGT and incident hypertension across baseline categories of drinking status (nondrinkers and current drinkers) and anthropometric measures, including BMI, waist circumference, and abdominal height, categorized by the median values.
Results
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants according to the subsequent development of hypertension. Mean values of age, anthropometric measures, concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides, blood pressure, and GGT were significantly higher among participants who became hypertensive than among those who remained normotensive, whereas no significant difference between the 2 groups was found in mean values of physical activity and alcohol consumption. Participants who became hypertensive were also significantly less educated and characterized at baseline by significantly lower percentage of women and higher percentage of smokers (both former and current), whereas no significant difference between the 2 groups was found in the baseline distribution of race and drinking status.
The mean values of the continuous characteristics at baseline by GGT quintiles are shown in Table 2. For all but education and physical activity, a significant linear trend was found across quintiles of GGT.
Table 3 displays the ORs of incident hypertension across baseline GGT quintiles. Model 1 is adjusted for age, gender, and race. Compared with the bottom quintile, the ORs of incident hypertension increased monotonically from quintile 2 through quintile 5: 0.8, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.7 (P for trend Ͻ0.0001). After further adjustment for baseline average amount of alcohol, smoking status, BMI, and physical activity (model 2), these risk estimates were only slightly attenu-

ated: 0.8, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.1 (P for trend Ͻ0.0001). Model 3 is adjusted further for baseline systolic blood pressure with little notable change: 0.9, 1.7, 2.0, and 2.1 (P for trend 0.002).
To examine any confounding by drinking status, we stratified the results by baseline drinking status. A significant linear relationship between GGT quintiles and incident hypertension was found among both nondrinkers (including lifetime abstainers and former drinkers) and current drinkers; however, the association was stronger among nondrinkers than among current drinkers with an OR of 3.5 (1.2 to 10.0) comparing Q5 versus Q1 in the fully adjusted model.
We also examined the impact of obesity and visceral fat on the results (Table 4). After stratification by the median values of baseline anthropometric measures, such as BMI, waist circumference, and abdominal height, GGT and incident HTN were significantly associated only among participants above the median of all anthropometric measures [eg, for BMI Ͼ26.4, 2.3 (0.9 to 5.7), for waist circumference Ͼ86.1 cm, 3.7 (1.4 to 9.9), and for abdominal height Ͼ19.8 cm, 3.1 (1.2 to 8.5), comparing Q5 versus Q1, in fully adjusted models]. However, it should be noted that the association between GGT and HTN, generally, appeared to be stronger among participants who were above the median of waist circumference and abdominal height compared with participants who were above the median of BMI in the fully adjusted model (model 3). These findings suggest that GGT may be differentially related to these anthropometric measures. To further examine this, we cross-classified tertiles of waist circumference and BMI. A direct and statistically significant relation between the age-adjusted mean values of

GGT and waist circumference persisted within each tertile of BMI (Figure 1). By contrast, no significant association was found between GGT and BMI across tertiles of waist circumference (Figure 2). Thus, these figures indicate that mean values of GGT vary as a function of waist circumference, independently of BMI.
Discussion
In this prospective population-based study GGT, within the physiological range, was a strong predictor of incident hypertension during 6 years of follow-up in a dose-response relationship. This association was independent of the effects of alcohol consumption and was present in both nondrinkers and drinkers; however, it appeared stronger among nondrinkers than among drinkers. When we evaluated the association between GGT and incident hypertension according to anthropometric measures of either relative weight, ie, BMI, or body fat distribution, ie, waist circumference and abdominal height, GGT was a significant predictor of incident hypertension only among the overweight and especially among persons with increased central fat distribution. The latter is a novel finding and is consistent with the hypothesis that fatty liver may represent an important underlying mechanism for the observed associations between GGT and hypertension.
Over the past 20 years, many cross-sectional studies and fewer longitudinal investigations have reported a positive association of GGT with blood pressure and risk of hypertension.2–7,12,13 This association has been shown to be independent of alcohol consumption and to be present among both drinkers and nondrinkers.2,7,13 Our findings are consis-

tent with previous work, further supporting the conclusion that the association between GGT and blood pressure is not mediated by alcohol consumption. Unfortunately, we were not able to assess this association separately in lifetime abstainers and former drinkers, because our sample size precluded us from performing meaningful comparisons within these subsets of drinkers. However, other studies have shown that GGT is associated with blood pressure even among lifetime abstainers.2
By contrast, the association of GGT with blood pressure has been shown to be affected by variation in body fat

distribution and parameters of insulin resistance. For example, in a study of 38-year-old Dutch men GGT was not associated with either systolic or diastolic blood pressure in multiple regression analysis including waist-to-hip circumference ratio, as a measure of body fat distribution, whereas the letter was significantly associated with diastolic blood pressure.1 Similarly, in a large population-based Italian study the significant univariate correlations between GGT and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were no longer significant in multiple regression analysis including blood lipids.9 A study of Japanese male workers showed that blood pressure

was more strongly related to plasma insulin levels after a glucose tolerance test than to GGT, and that GGT was no longer significantly associated with blood pressure after adjustment for insulin levels.6 Our findings extend previous work and indicate that the association of GGT with hypertension risk is strongly affected by variation in relative weight and, above all, body fat distribution. Specifically, we found that GGT was a significant predictor of incident hypertension only among overweight or individuals with increased central fat distribution. In addition, the association between GGT and HTN appeared to be stronger among participants who were above the median of waist circumference and abdominal height than among those who were above the median of BMI. Our results also indicate that mean values of GGT vary as a function of waist circumference independent of BMI, supporting the notion that central adiposity may represent a stronger predictor of elevated liver enzymes including GGT than relative weight, as assessed by BMI.19,20 Because central adiposity can correlate with the development of fatty liver,21–23 our findings further support the hypothesis that NAFL may represent an important underlying mechanism for the observed associations between GGT and hypertension. Moreover, the association between hepatic insulin resistance and fatty liver has been shown in several clinical studies and some authors have suggested that fatty liver should be considered part of the metabolic syndrome.24–26 In addition, there is evidence that both fatty liver and central obesity are associated with increased free radical generation.27,28 It is known that GGT has a protective function in maintaining appropriate hepatic glutathione levels, which are crucial in antioxidant

defenses.16 Therefore, it is possible that the generation of free radicals, which can occur in fatty liver and central obesity, may deplete intracellular glutathione and thus induce the activity of GGT to enhance glutathione levels. The increase in GGT at the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes can lead to an increased release of GGT into the circulation. Unfortunately, in our study we did not assess at baseline plasma insulin levels and could not further investigate the association between GGT and parameters of insulin resistance.
Consistently with previous work,13 in our study no association was found between hypertension risk and other hepatic enzymes including ALT, AST, and ALP (data not shown). The lack of association between hypertension risk and more specific enzymes of liver damage (ALT and AST) further suggests that the association of GGT, within its normal range, and hypertension may be caused by an increased condition of oxidative stress produced by either central adiposity or fatty liver rather than to merely liver damage. Additionally, there is evidence that GGT can act as a pro-oxidant and lead to formation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation,16,37 which are pathologic mechanisms commonly associated with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors.38
When we performed analyses including participants with elevated GGT (Ͼ55 U/L), the point estimates of hypertension risk among these participants were somewhat attenuated and not significant (data not shown). Although these findings indicate that the predictive value of GGT for hypertension may decrease in persons with potential liver damage, they further support the hypothesis that GGT, within its normal range, may represent an early and sensitive biomarker for the

development of hypertension as well as of other components of the metabolic syndrome.10,13,14
Several limitations of this study deserve mention. First, the suboptimal initial participation rate (59.5%) and reexamination rate (68.0%) may leave the possibility for selection bias and restrict the generalization of our findings to the general public. However, this would not affect the internal validity of our results. Second, we cannot rule out the presence of additional unknown confounding variables that we were unable to control for in our analyses, and the potential of residual confounding that, in the absence of a known physiological link, may have contributed to our findings. The strengths of this study include the very detailed information elicited on several covariates known to be related to either GGT or blood pressure elevation including alcohol consumption and several measures of body fatness. A further strength is that we enrolled participants randomly selected from a community-wide population.
Perspectives Our study adds new and important information to the current body of evidence about the association of GGT with hypertension and other components of the metabolic syndrome. Our findings indicate that the association between GGT and hypertension is not caused solely by alcohol consumption; in addition, they further support the hypothesis that NAFL, and its metabolic consequences (eg, insulin resistance), may represent an important link between GGT and components of the metabolic syndrome. These findings may have both clinical and public health implications if we consider that fatty liver is the most common cause of liver injury in the United States.39 Population-based studies are necessary to further investigate the association between fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance. Moreover, experimental studies are needed also to better understand the physiological functions of GGT with respect to oxidative stress and to support the epidemiologic and clinical evidence regarding the association between metabolic abnormalities and fatty liver.

Morning blood pressure surge is associated with serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in essential hypertensive patients
R Elsurer1 and B Afsar2
The phenomenon that blood pressure rises sharply in the morning is called ‘Morning Blood Pressure Surge’ (MBPS). Serum gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) is a proinﬂammatory marker involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Although both are novel cardiovascular risk factors associated with inﬂammation and atherosclerosis, the speciﬁc relationship between MBPS and serum GGT is unknown. This study investigates the relationship between MBPS and serum GGT activity in essential hypertensive patients. Totally, 320 hypertensive patients were recruited. Mean MBPS was 17.0 ± 12.9 mm Hg. MBPS was positively correlated with age (r = +0.222, P o0.0001), body mass index (r = +0.132, P = 0.018), GGT (r = +0.271, P o0.0001), daytime augmentation index adjusted for heart rate (AIx@75) (r = +0.140, P = 0.014), 24-h pulse wave velocity (PWV) (r = +0.143, P = 0.014) and daytime PWV (r = +0.158, P = 0.007). From the 25th to 75th quartile of serum GGT, MBPS increased signiﬁcantly (Ptrend o 0.0001). In multivariate linear regression analysis, MBPS was independently associated with age (P = 0.002), dipping status (P o 0.0001) and logGGT (P o 0.0001). In conclusion, MBPS is independently associated serum GGT activity in essential hypertensive patients. This is the ﬁrst study in the literature to demonstrate an independent and a dose–response relationship between the two novel cardiovascular risk factors, MBPS and serum GGT, in this patient population.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of hypertension as a risk factor of target organ
damage and cardiovascular disease is widely acknowledged.
Although clinic blood pressure (BP) is used as the primary tool for
the diagnosis and management of hypertension, out of clinic BP
measurements, by the use of ambulatory BP monitoring, is
considered more reliable than clinic BP measurements because they are more reproducible.1
BP exhibits a diurnal variation, reaching the highest level in the
morning and then declining to reach a trough level at night. The
phenomenon that BP rises sharply in the morning is called ‘Morning Blood Pressure Surge’ (MBPS). MBPS has been reported to occur in response to sudden activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased α-mediated sympathetic activity,2 and can be measured reliably using ambulatory BP monitoring. MBPS is considered to be a cardiovascular risk factor.1 The study by Kario et al.3 was the ﬁrst to show that an excessive MPBS was a predictor of subsequent stroke in elderly hypertensive patients,
independent of ambulatory BP levels and target organ damage.
Subsequently, in the Ohasama study, an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage was observed in subjects with a large MBPS (⩾25 mm Hg).4 Recently, Li et al.5 reported that MBPS exceeding the 90th percentile was a signiﬁcant and independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events.
Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), a plasma membrane-
bound enzyme, has been used as a biological marker for alcohol intake or liver cell damage.6 GGT has a pro-oxidative effect, as it is
involved in the degradation of the antioxidant glutathione, and
has an indirect pro-oxidative effect by causing low-density

lipoprotein cholesterol oxidation in the presence of iron. GGT is also considered as a proinﬂammatory marker, and serum GGT activity found within atherosclerotic lesions directly contributes to atherosclerosis progression.7 Studies have shown that serum GGT might have a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke and metabolic syndrome.6,7 Shankar et al.8 reported that higher serum GGT levels were positively associated with prehypertension in US adults free of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Stranges et al.9 showed that serum GGT, within the physiological range, was a strong predictor of incident hypertension in a dose–response relationship. Kawamoto et al.10 reported that both systolic and diastolic BPs increased signiﬁcantly with increasing GGT levels among communitydwelling men in Japan. Most recently, Chun et al.6 and Kim et al.7 disclosed that serum GGT was independently associated with incident prehypertension and hypertension in Korean adults, respectively.
In this study, we investigated whether MBPS, which is a cardiovascular risk factor, is associated with serum GGT in patients with essential hypertension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS The study had a single-center, cross-sectional design. Totally, 320 consecutive patients from outpatient clinics with essential hypertension who agreed to participate in this study were recruited. The study protocol complied with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000, and was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. All participants gave informed consent. The exclusion criteria were the presence of secondary

332 hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, inﬂammatory diseases (acute infection, autoimmune diseases), malignancy, sleep apnea, positive HBsAg and/or positive anti-HCV antibody tests and shift working. None of the patients had alcohol abuse. Patients with known coronary artery disease, who were free from acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary revascularization procedure within the last 3 months, were included. All patients underwent the following procedures; anamnesis, physical examination, routine biochemical testing, ofﬁce and ambulatory BP monitoring and calculation of sleepthrough MBPS. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as (weight (kg))/(height (m))2. Hypertension was deﬁned as systolic BP (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or more, diastolic BP (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or more or both. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus was based on the American Diabetes Association criteria.11 Coronary artery disease was deﬁned as a history of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary revascularization procedure (coronary stent replacement and coronary artery by-pass graft surgery). Cerebrovascular disease was deﬁned as a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack or carotid revascularization procedure. Peripheral arterial disease was deﬁned as a history of intermittent claudication, ischemic leg ulcer, peripheral revascularization or amputation for critical limb ischemia. Level of kidney function was assessed by estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) calculated by Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease formula,12 as follows; eGFR (ml min− 1 per 1.73 m2) = 186 × serum creatinine (mg dl − 1) − 1.154 × age (years) − 0.203 × (1.210 if African-American) × (0.742 if female).
Ofﬁce BP measurement Ofﬁce BP measurements were recorded by Omron MZ model (Omron Health Care, Mukou City, Kyoto, Japan) sphygmomanometer. BPs were measured according to European Society of Hypertension Guidelines.13
Ambulatory BP measurement
Ambulatory BP measurement was performed by the validated Mobil-OGraph Arteriograph (I.E.M. GmbH, Stolberg, Germany) device based on the method described in elsewhere.14 All patients were instructed to rest or sleep between 2200 and 0700 hours (nighttime) and to continue their usual activities between 0700 and 2200 hours (daytime). By using Mobil-OGraph arteriograph device with an ARC solver method (Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna), pulse wave forms from brachial artery were recorded during 24 h. This new BP monitor oscillometrically captures pulse wave form from brachial artery by an upper-arm cuff and measures pulse wave velocity (PWV). Within a single measurement cycle, cuff pressure is hold for a time period of 10 s at diastolic value during cuff deﬂation. Recording time of oscillometric signal at diastolic level allows derivation of augmentation index adjusted for heart rate (AIx@75). Measurements were automatically calculated during 24-h, daytime and nighttime.14,15
Morning BP was deﬁned as the average of BPs during the ﬁrst 2 h after wake-up time (four BP readings). The lowest BP was deﬁned as the average BP of three readings centered on the lowest nighttime reading (that is, the lowest reading plus the readings immediately before and after). The sleepthrough MBPS was calculated as the morning SBP minus the lowest SBP.3
Biochemical analysis
Blood samples were obtained after participants had fasted overnight. Complete blood counts were made by using automated blood counting device. Serum uric acid was determined by enzymatic method. Other biochemical parameters were measured by standard methods.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normality of data was evaluated by Kolmogorov– Smirnov test (Lilliefors modiﬁcation). Data are shown as mean ± s.d. for normally distributed continuous variables, median (range) for nonnormally distributed continuous variables, and as a percentage (%), where appropriate. Spearman nonparametric correlation analysis was run between the MBPS and the clinical, laboratory and ambulatory BP parameters and eGFR. Kendall’s Tau correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between MBPS and the dipping status. Scatterplot graphic between MBPS and logGGT was run with Pearson correlation analysis. Comparison of the MBPS among GGT quartiles was carried out by

one-way analysis of variance test. For the posthoc comparison, Tukey test was used. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed with stepwise method to determine the possible factors (including age, gender, BMI, smoking, 24-h SBP, 24-h DBP, dipping status, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, use of acetylsalicylic acid, statin and antihypertensive drugs, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, logGGT and logeGFR as variables) independently related to MBPS. Because GGT and eGFR were not normally distributed, logarithmic conversion was performed before linear regression analysis. Results were considered statistically signiﬁcant if twotailed P is less than 0.05.
RESULTS Totally, 320 hypertensive patients (male/female: 133/187) were included. Table 1 demonstrates the basal demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. Overall, 79.7% of the patients were nondippers. The laboratory characteristics and eGFR of the study population are shown in Table 2.

The median eGFR was 80.8 ml min − 1 per 1.73 m2. Table 3 demonstrates the ofﬁce and ambulatory BP parameters, PWV and AIx@75 of the study population. The mean MBPS was
17.0 ± 12.9 mm Hg. The correlation analysis revealed that MBPS was positively
correlated with age (r: +0.222, P o0.0001), BMI (r: +0.132, P: 0.018), GGT (r: +0.271, P o 0.0001), daytime AIx@75 (r: +0.140, P: 0.014), 24-hour PWV (r: +0.143, P: 0.014) and daytime PWV (r: +0.158, P: 0.007). The MBPS was positively correlated with logGGT (r: +0.293, P o 0.0001) (Figure 1). In Kendall’s Tau correlation analysis, MBPS was correlated with the dipping status (r: − 0.216, P o0.0001). The other parameters were not correlated with MBPS (Table 4). From the 25th to 75th quartile of serum GGT, MBPS increased signiﬁcantly (Ptrend o 0.0001) (Figure 2). Post hoc analysis showed that MBPS was signiﬁcantly different between o 25th and 475th quartiles (P o 0.0001), 25th-50th and 475th quartiles (P: 0.001) and 50th–75th and 475th quartiles (P: 0.048).
Multivariate linear regression analysis for factors that might be
associated with MBPS (the model included age, gender, BMI,
smoking, 24-h SBP, 24-h DBP, dipping status, diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease, use of acetylsalicylic acid, statin and
antihypertensive drugs, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase,
logGGT and logeGFR as independent variables) demonstrated
that MBPS was independently associated with age (P: 0.023), dipping status (P o 0.0001) and logGGT (P o 0.0001) (Table 5).

GGT, MBPS increased signiﬁcantly. In adjusted analysis, MBPS was
independently associated only with age, dipping status and logGGT. This is the ﬁrst study in the literature to demonstrate an
independent association between MBPS and serum GGT, which is a proinﬂammatory marker, in patients with essential hypertension.
BP ﬂuctuates in a daily pattern of peaks and troughs known as the ‘Circadian Rhythm’.16 In the early morning, an abrupt and
steep acceleration in BP occurs, coincident with arousal and rising
from overnight sleep. A slow but steady increase in BP is then observed over the early morning hours.17 This is known as the ‘Morning Blood Pressure Surge’, and is thought to result from
increased physical activity and endogenous factors, such as sympathetic nervous system and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activities, and endothelial function.16–18 Nitric oxide
production rises during morning hours in normotensives, a rise
that can be disrupted in patients with hypertension, further potentiating vasoconstriction.17 MBPS, which is determined by a
sum of physiologic and unphysiologic factors, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.19 MBPS contributes to target organ damage 2 and is positively correlated with left ventricular mass and increased carotid intima–media thickness.20 The landmark study by Kario et al.3 showed an association between the MBPS
and cardiovascular risk. The authors reported that the top MBPS
decile had a threefold greater risk of multiple infarcts or stroke
after adjustment for 24-h BP and dipping status. Lee et al.21 reported that in never-treated essential hypertensive
patients, with no other cardiovascular risk factors, age was an independent risk factor for MBPS.21 Neutel et al.16 found that
increasing age was associated with a higher SBP MBPS. However,

in the multivariate analysis, age was not signiﬁcantly associated with MBPS and the authors suggested that the age effect is fully
accounted for by changes in other variables, such as BP variability in elderly patients. On the other hand, Sun et al.22 reported that in hypertensive individuals, MBPS was correlated with age. Similarly,
we found that MBPS was positively correlated with age in hypertensive individuals, and the association remained signiﬁcant even after adjusting for potential confounders.
Lee et al.21 disclosed a weak and not statistically signiﬁcant association between MBPS and BMI in never-treated hypertensive patients. In the study by Neutel et al.,16 MBPS was not affected by BMI in hypertensive patients. In the present study, although we
showed a positive correlation between MBPS and BMI, the association lost signiﬁcance in adjusted analysis.
Cross-sectional studies have indicated that MBPS is associated
with vascular remodeling such as atherosclerosis, arterial stiffening and small vessel disease. Inﬂammation also has an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Studies have reported that inﬂammatory status is associated with MBPS and MBPS-related atherosclerotic lesions.23 GGT is an enzyme expressed in serum and
most cell surfaces. Emerging evidence has shown that serum GGT
might be an important enzyme in the pathogenesis of cardiovas-
cular diseases and GGT has been suggested as a novel biomarker of cardiovascular risk.6,24 The role of GGT in cardiovascular disease is
partly explained by its correlation with conventional cardiovascular
risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
and metabolic syndrome, irrespective of alcohol consumption.
However, the exact mechanism linking GGT and cardiovascular disease is still unclear.25 GGT has a direct role in the generation of
reactive oxygen species in the presence of iron or other transition
metals, including lipid peroxidation in human biological membranes
and is an indirect marker of antioxidant systems, with the primary
function of maintaining the intracellular concentration of glutathione in response to oxidative stress.10 GGT has also been used as a proinﬂammatory marker because of its indirect involvement in the generation of cysteinyl-glycine, which results in low-density
lipoprotein oxidation. The enzyme activity of serum GGT found
within atherosclerotic lesions directly contributes to atherosclerosis progression.7 The current evidence suggests that MBPS and serum
GGT are the two novel cardiovascular risk factors associated with inﬂammation and atherosclerosis. However, the speciﬁc relationship between MBPS and serum GGT activity is a matter of interest.
Recent studies disclosed that serum GGT activity is related with BP changes. Chun et al.6 reported that serum GGT was positively associated with the incident prehypertension in healthy Korean men. Karakurt et al.26 found that serum GGT level was higher in patients with prehypertension group than in the control group in Turkish men and women. Stranges et al.9 showed that serum GGT was a signiﬁcant predictor of incident hypertension among overweight persons with increased central fat distribution. Kotani et al.27 disclosed that the degree of increase in SBP (and DBP only in non-diabetic subjects) was signiﬁcantly, independently and positively correlated to that of GGT in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. In this study, we speciﬁcally investigated the relationship between MBPS and serum GGT in patients with essential hypertension. We ﬁrstly demonstrated that MBPS was positively correlated with serum GGT (in a dose–response relationship), which remained signiﬁcant in adjusted analysis along with age and dipping status. The mechanisms underlying
the relationship between serum GGT and BP changes are not fully
understood. First, serum GGT has been interpreted as a reliable
marker of oxidative stress, which increases BP by direct
vasoconstriction and sodium retention in the vascular smooth
muscle and endothelial cells. Second, insulin resistance could have
a role in the association between serum GGT and BP changes,
because GGT might be interpreted as a marker for hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance.6 Nonetheless, this issue
warrants further prospective and interventional studies.

Increasing arterial stiffness is closely associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.28 Because pulse wave travels faster in arteries with decreased elasticity, arterial stiffness could be measured by PWV.2 Augmentation index (AIx) is a composite index that integrates the amount of wave that is reﬂected back to aorta and the velocity of incident and reﬂected wave.29 Aortic PWV and AIx are indices of arterial stiffness and are predictors for cardiovascular diseases.30 There is a paucity of studies investigating the relationship between arterial stiffness and MBPS. Suh et al.2 studied the association of MBPS with PWV in healthy Korean women. They showed that although arterial stiffness did not show signiﬁcant association with MBPS, it was associated with higher morning BP. However, their participants were nonhypertensive and they used maximum morning BPpower for evaluation of MBPS. Contrarily, Polonia et al.31 reported that MBPS was correlated signiﬁcantly with PWV. In our study, we showed that MBPS was positively correlated with daytime AIx@75, 24-h PWV and daytime PWV in hypertensive individuals.
This study has limitations that deserve mention. First, our study had a cross-sectional design, which precludes deriving a cause–effect relationship between MBPS and serum GGT activity. Second, although patients were instructed to rest or sleep between predeﬁned hours, the precise sleeping patterns of the patients are unknown. Third, we excluded patients with known viral hepatitis, but as we did not perform routine hepatic ultrasonography, we cannot completely rule out parenchymal liver diseases (fatty liver, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and so on). Fourth, different kidney function levels may inﬂuence the relationship between MBPS and GGT. However, in the current study, we had limited number of patients with loss of renal function; only 78 patients had eGFR ⩽ 60 ml min − 1 per 1.73 m2, which precluded us performing subgroup analysis according to stages of chronic kidney disease due to low statistical power. This issue merits further investigation. Lastly, as being hypertensive, our patients were on antihypertensive treatment and this may have been disadvantageous during MBPS assessment. Lastly, we relied on a single serum GGT measurement. However, on the other hand, our patient population is composed of patients with somewhat high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, our ﬁndings deserve critical attention.
In conclusion, MBPS is independently associated serum GGT activity in essential hypertensive patients. This is the ﬁrst study in the literature to demonstrate an independent and a dose–response relationship between the two novel cardiovascular risk factors, MBPS and serum GGT, in this patient population.
What is known about topic ● Morning blood pressure surge is a novel cardiovascular risk factor. ● Gamma-glutamyltransferase is an enzyme involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and a novel biomarker of cardiovascular risk.

Abstract g-Glutamyl transferase (GGT) participates in oxidative and inflammatory reactions inside the atheroma plaque and platelets. We evaluated whether platelet membrane g-glutamyl transferase (Plt-GGT) activity is a predictor of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) during 3 months follow-up of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS; MACE-3M). We included 105 patients who were hospitalized consecutively with the diagnosis of ACS. Patients with an MACE-3M were older, more likely to have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of coronary artery disease(CAD), thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) risk score >4, higher Plt-GGT and serum GGT activities, serum C-reactive protein level, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) when compared to those without MACE-3M (all P values .05). By receiver–operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, 265 mU/mg for Plt-GGT, 30 U/L for serum GGT, and 45% for LVEF were determined as cutoff values to discriminate MACEs. Platelet GGT activity >265 mU/mg, TIMI risk score >4, and family history of CAD were independent predictors of MACE-3M (all P values <.05). Platelet GGT activity was as an independent predictor for MACEs in patients with ACS during the 3 months follow-up.

Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD), which accounts for the major-
ity of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), causes >7 million deaths per year worldwide.1 The most important cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is plaque rupture.2 The lipid
content released by the rupture of the fibrous capsule pos-
sesses thrombogenic activity and contains high amounts of tissue factor.2 After the erosion of endothelial cells, collagen
exposure leads to adhesion and activation of platelets via von Willebrand factor (deposited with P-selectin in platelets).3
Platelet activation stimulates the thrombotic cascade intertwined with inflammatory pathways.3
Serum g-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels are used as a
marker of alcohol consumption and impaired liver function and
have been shown to correlate with oxidative and inflammatory events.4 g-Glutamyl transferase activity has been confirmed
within atheromatous plaques by histopathological examination.5 g-Glutamyl transferase is also known to have prognostic significance in patients with myocardial infarction (MI).6
However, the tissue and cellular sources of elevated serum
GGT in CVDs have not yet been established. The different
isoforms of GGT have been determined based on relative mobility on electrophoresis (GGT1-GGT5).7 These isoforms can be

found in serum in different amounts in various clinicopathological conditions.8
g-Glutamyl transferase 4 isoforms have been found in the platelets and neutrophils.7 It is known that GGT converts leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D4 in the platelet cell membrane, and these products are also prothrombotic.9 The concentration of GGT in the platelet membrane may reflect the level of platelet activation.9 The activity of GGTs in the platelets and their electrophoretic behaviors are different from those in the serum.7 g-Glutamyl transferase in the platelets produces a distinct electrophoretic band and has different substrate interactions than those seen in the serum. It is understood that the

activity measured in the serum is due to the composition of GGT isoforms originating from many tissues.7,9,10
The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of platelet membrane GGT (Plt-GGT) activity for the development of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs; recurrent angina pectoris, MI, rehospitalization due to ACS, and death) after a 3-month follow-up (MACE-3M) in patients hospitalized with ACS.
Methods
Patients hospitalized (n ¼ 105) with a prediagnosis of ACS at Baskent University Cardiology Clinic, between May 2007 and July 2007, were included in the study consecutively after obtaining written informed consents. The follow-up continued till the end of October 2007. The study was approved by Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Clinical Research Ethics Committee (approval dated February 05, 2007, and number 07/ 90). Patients diagnosed with an increased concentration of liver enzymes, active hepatobiliary disease, active use of alcohol, who underwent major surgery (vascular, pulmonary, cerebral, hepatobiliary, or genitourinary) within the last 4 weeks, definite diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular event, peripheral arterial embolism and thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis and active malignancy, active tuberculosis, AIDS, and other immunodeficiency were excluded from the study.
Three months after discharge, the patients were investigated for recurrent angina or angina equivalent symptoms, hospitalization due to ACS and death (MACE-3M), either during follow-up examinations or via telephone calls. If any death was reported within this 3-month period, the cause of death (cardiac or non-cardiac) was recorded.
Hypertension (HT) was defined as documentation of a systolic blood pressure of !140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of !90 mm Hg in at least 2 measurements or active use of any antihypertensive agent. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed as a fasting plasma glucose level over 126 mg/dL or glucose level over 200 mg/dL at any measurement or active use of an antidiabetic agent. Hyperlipidemia (HL) was defined according to the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) Final Report.11
Venous blood samples were obtained from the patients using a thick needle (20G ¼ 0.9 mm) and were placed in tubes containing acid–citrate–dextrose (ACD; composition: 38 mmol/L citric acid, 75 mmol/L sodium citrate, and 124 mmol/L dextrose) in a ratio of 1.5 mL ACD/8.5 mL blood. After the sample was “rested” for 15 minutes, it was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 8 minutes to obtain platelet-rich plasma.9,12 This plasma was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes to remove the remaining platelet cell pellet. The precipitate thus obtained was washed 3 times with cell washing solution (0.003 mmol/L Tris–HCl bufferþ0.12 mmol/L NaClþ0.005 mmol/L EDTA, adjusted to pH 7.4) and was

recentrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes. The washed platelet precipitate was mixed with distilled water. It was then frozen and thawed 4 times with addition of distilled water for cell lysis. Frozen and thawed platelets were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10 000 rpm. The precipitate was suspended in 0.01 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, aiming a cool incubation for 5 hours at 4C with gentle stirring, and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4C to give a clear supernatant.13
The enzymatic colorimetric test was performed for measuring GGT activity at 37C in patients’ serum and obtained supernatant. L-g-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-nitroaniline was used as the substrate. The analysis was performed using a RocheHitachi analyzer (Mannheim, Germany). g-Glutamyl transferase values were measured in units per liter (U/L). Total protein was determined in the obtained supernatant according to the Bradford method13 and also with enzymatic colorimetric assay at 37C, using a Roche-Hitachi analyzer (Mannheim, Germany). Because of the identical measurements of protein amounts by these 2 methods, colorimetric assay had been used in entire cases. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride values were measured using an enzymatic colorimetric assay at 37C, using a Roche-Hitachi analyzer (Mannheim, Germany), and the concentrations were measured in mg/dL.
The following formula was used to calculate the “Plt-GGTspecific activity” and expressed in mU/mg for easy comparison of the small numbers (Plt-GGT: U/mg ¼ 1000 mU/mg):

Statistical Analysis
All calculations were performed using Statistical Program for the Social Services Version (13.0) software. The continuous variables were expressed as mean (standard deviation) and median (interquartile range). The categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentage. The data were tested for normal distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The comparison of differences between the groups was done using w2 (chisquare) test for categorical variables and independent sample t-test for continuous variables. The cutoff values for the parameters investigated were calculated using the receiver– operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Single Cox regression analysis was used to analyze parameters that were determinant for MACE-3M. Independent determinants of MACE-3M were recorded using the multiple Cox regression analysis. All P values were 2 sided, and P .05 was considered significant.

Results
Of all the patients, 77 (73.3%) were male, 28 (26.7%) were female, and the mean age of the patients was 61.9 (10.5) years. The median Plt-GGT level of the patients was 170.3 (88.3-355.0) mU/mg. A total of 105 patients were followed

up to investigate the development of MACE-3M after discharge. In all, 60 (57.1%) patients were diagnosed as unstable angina pectoris (USAP), 28 (26.7%) patients were diagnosed as non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and 17 (16.2%) patients were diagnosed as STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Of these patients, 30 (28.6%) developed MACE-3M (recurrent angina in 18 patients, MI in 10 patients, hospitalization due to ACS in 14 patients, and cardiac death in 4 patients). Clinical characteristics, medications used, and laboratory findings of the patients are shown in Table 1.

A significant difference was found between the patients with and without MACE-3M in terms of the mean age (66.2 [11.0] and 60.2 [10] years; P ¼ .01), being older than 70 years (46.7% and 18.7%; P ¼ .003), HT (80.0% and 57.3%; P ¼ .029), and HL (80% and 60%; P ¼ .05). The laboratory parameters that showed significant differences between the groups were Plt-GGT, 267 (191-640) mU/mg and 125 (72-300) mU/mg; P < .001], serum GGT (33 [17] and 27[13] U/L; P ¼ .05, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (13 [8.2] and 7.8 [4.9] mg/L; P ¼ .044). There were no significant differences between 2 groups about the other liver function tests such as aspartate

aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. There were no significant differences between 2 groups regarding the medication used such as acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, and statins which could affect platelet function and atherosclerotic plaque stabilization. Among the study population, 77 (73.3%) patients were smoking. There was no significant difference regarding smoking between the patients with and without MACE-3M, 24 (80%) and 53 (70.7%); P ¼ .329. Platelet GGT and serum GGT levels were significantly higher in the smoking group compared to nonsmokers (for Plt-GGT: 245 [111-415] mU/mg vs 111 [60-240] mU/mg; P ¼ .006; for Serum GGT: 32 [15] vs 25 [13] U/L; P ¼ .036, respectively). The clinical characteristics, medications used, and the laboratory parameters of patients with and without MACE-3M are given in Table 1.
It was seen that the Plt-GGT-specific activity at the time of admission increased proportional to the clinical severity of ACS. The analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the median Plt-GGT activities in each diagnostic step from USAP to NSTEMI and STEMI, USAP 126 (71-273) mU/ mg, NSTEMI_ 226 (106-353) mU/mg, and STEMI_ 365 (287516) mU/mg; P ¼ .01, P ¼ .021, and P < .001.
The cutoff values as calculated by ROC curve analysis were used in single and multiple regression analyses and are as follows: LVEF <45%, Plt-GGT >265 mU/mg, serum GGT activity >30 U/L, serum CRP levels >4 mg/L, and length of hospitalization >5 days.

Plt-GGT-specific activity >265 mU/mg at the time of admission (Table 2).
When the mean Plt-GGT-specific activities were compared using the clinical TIMI score groups, it was found that PltGGT-specific activity showed a steady increase toward the high-risk groups with a strong statistical significance (TIMI 1 to TIMI 6-8 analysis of variance; P < .0001; Figure 5).

Discussion
The most valuable finding of our study was that Plt-GGT activity seems to be a strong predictor of MACE-3M in patients

hospitalized with ACS, correlating with known prognostic indicator TIMI risk score. The level of Plt-GGT specific activity was associated with the clinical severity of ACS.
Our study population consisted of high-risk patients, so the TIMI risk score was >4 in 41% of them. An increase in TIMI risk score was associated with Plt-GGT activity; a TIMI risk score >4 was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in MACE-3M. Therefore, the specific activity of Plt-GGT measured at hospital admission may help to identify and manage high-risk patients, since it was found to be an independent variable for the development of MACEs and to provide similar results with the globally accepted TIMI risk score.
Approximately 20% of all patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain are diagnosed with ACS.14 During admission and in-hospital follow-up in patients with an ACS, risk stratification is of paramount importance. We intend to investigate the Plt-GGT as a novel biochemical marker for risk stratification of ACSs.
The MACE-3M was significantly higher in the patients having a Plt-GGT-specific activity >265 mU/mg. Platelet GGT >265 mU/mg was found to be an independent predictor for MACE-3M by multiple regression analysis. Until now, no study has been published that emphasizes the prognostic significance of Plt-GGT for any CVD. Therefore, it is not possible to exactly compare with similar studies. However, previous studies have shown that high serum GGT activity has a prognostic value in patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of ACS15 or after MI.6
g-Glutamyl transferase has been shown to directly participate in oxidative events related to the formation of the atheromatous plaque.16 It is considered that the migration of GGT into the plaque occurs via LDL.16 g-Glutamyl transferase is also present in the platelet membrane and converts leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D4.9 An increased excretion of leukotriene D4 and E4 has been found in patients after MI and coronary artery bypass surgery.17

Angiology XX(X)

An important issue that determines long-term MACEs in the ACS clinic is multiple vulnerable lesions that produce greater risk for recurrent ischemic events.18-20 In angiographic studies, it has been observed that even if the culprit lesion is successfully treated with an interventional approach, the remaining unstable plaques are responsible for recurrent events.18-20 Platelet GGT activity, which is claimed to be a marker of platelet function,9 may be thought to be mediated from platelets during plaque rupture thrombus formation in the ACS clinic. The view that the cumulative GGT activities in serum and platelets are related to the amount of thrombus supports our finding that PltGGT activity is associated with severity of ACS. It can be argued that the Plt-GGT-specific activity increased due to the excess amount of inflamed plaques (vulnerable plaques), which is not responsible for the ACS presentation at admission; however, it is constantly in contact with platelets in the coronary circulation and increases the tonic reactivity of platelets as a trigger for transient micro-thrombosis, while accelerating the platelet cycle. This also explains the fact that a Plt-GGT level >265 mU/mg was determined to be an independent variable for the development of MACEs in the following days and months.
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most important determinant of MACEs in the patients with acute MI. Several studies have shown that the LVEF measured in intensive care unit is predictive of 1-year survival after acute MI.21-24 It has been shown in previous studies that the rate of death increases within 6 months after acute MI when LVEF falls below 40%.25 The mean LVEF values of patients included in the present study were higher than those in similar studies (mean [SD] ¼ 47.9 [9.5]%). However, the rate of the development of adverse events within the 3-month follow-up period was significantly higher in patients with an LVEF <45% compared to those with an LVEF >45%. Unfortunately, LVEF <45% was not found to be an independent predictor of the development of MACE-3M in this study. This may be due to the short duration of the follow-up (3-months) and small sample size. This result could also be due to the fact that the LVEF values of patients in this study were better than those in the other studies.
The patients older than 70 years of age who are admitted with ACS are always at a high risk in the long term.26,27 The age of >70 years was found to be the most important predictor of prognosis in patients with NSTEMI in a study28 and STEMI in another study.29 The rate of the development of adverse events within the 3-month follow-up period was significantly higher in patients older than 70 years when compared to those younger than 70 years of age in the present study, and this was in accordance with the literature. The age >70 years alone was found to be a predictor of MACE-3M.
Cigarette smoking induces inflammation and oxidative stress.30,31 In this study, we found an increase in serum GGT and Plt-GGT in smokers confirming previous studies.32 Nevertheless, smoking could not predict MACE-3M during our follow-up probably due to our small sample size. It has been shown that smoking increases serum GGT activity in a dosedependent manner and with co-use of alcohol. Whitehead et al

found that the effect of cigarette on serum GGT was significant in amounts up to 3 to 4 units/d of alcohol consumption.33 They showed that cigarette smoking significantly increases the activity of GGT in drinkers. Those who consume alcohol at this level were not included in our study group. Our patients are usually teetotalers and occasional drinkers. These conditions might have weakened the relation between smoking and MACE-3M in our study. In addition, as a limitation of our study, the total amount of cigarettes smoked daily by our patients was not recorded. We think that smoking as a risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis is associated with increased serum GGT and Plt-GGT activities in patients with NSTEMI and STEMI with high thrombotic activity. In these patients, we tried to measure the Plt-GGT which we thought could be used as a platelet activation indicator and to investigate the relationship with MACE-3M. Further research should compare the amount of cigarette consumption with Plt-GGT in patients with ACS and distinguish which GGT isoenzyme is affected by smoking. The effect of various treatments also needs to be assessed.
Besides, significant statistical correlation was found between serum GGT level and MACE-3M in the present study, the risk coefficient and the predictive value of Plt-GGTspecific activity for MACE-3M were higher than the values obtained with serum GGT. This suggests that platelets might be a source of serum GGT activity.
It is not known whether the negative impact of Plt-GGTspecific activity on prognosis can be reversed by the drugs or surgical and percutaneous revascularization methods used in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease. It must be assessed in future studies whether any drug decreases the Plt-GGT activity; if found so, the effect of this decline on the prognosis must also be evaluated.
Our study is single centered, small scaled, and short termed in follow-up. Therefore, examination of the effects of riskreducing drug treatments on MACE development was not possible. Also, the course of Plt-GGT-specific activity in patient groups during follow-up was not investigated.
Platelet GGT-specific activity was found to be an independent predictor of MACE-3M and a stronger prognostic marker than serum GGT activity. Platelet GGT>265 mU/mg, TIMI risk score >4, family history of CAD, duration of stay in coronary care unit (CCU) >5 days, and age >70 years were considered as independent predictors of the development of MACE-3M. In addition, the activity of Plt-GGT was increased with the clinical severity of ACS. New confirmative large-scale studies will be noteworthy for investigating the Plt-GGT (GGT4) as a novel biochemical marker for risk stratification of ACSs in a practical manner like giving way to a new Elisa kit design measuring Plt-GGT (GGT4) in serum.

We performed a prospective study to assess whether the relationship of age with hypertension was stronger in men with high normal serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) than in those with lower GGT levels. The study population included 8170 healthy male workers in a steel manufacturing company who had undergone health examinations in both 1994 and 1998. The higher the baseline GGT level, the effect of age on the development of hypertension was stronger. The incidence of hypertension among those aged 25–34, 35–44 and 45–50 years was 0.9, 2.2, 3.8% in those with GGTo20 U/l; 1.0, 4.1, 12.5% in those with GGT between 20 and 39 U/l; and 1.9, 6.3, 17.2% in those with GGTX40 U/l,

respectively. All relationships persisted after adjusting for baseline values of body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking, exercise, family history of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and changes of body mass index during 4 years (P for interaction ¼ 0.03). Our data supported the hypothesis that the effect of age on the development of hypertension differed by baseline GGT level, although the underlying mechanism for this interaction is unclear.

Introduction
In our previous longitudinal studies,1,2 we reported a strong dose–response relationships between serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) at baseline and development of type II diabetes. Although GGT has been widely used as a marker of alcohol consumption or liver disease,3 neither alcohol nor hepatic dysfunction explained the observed relationships between GGT and diabetes. In addition, the typical relationships between age or obesity and type II diabetes were shown only among those with high normal GGT level at baseline.1,2
In the same cohorts,2,4 GGT was a modest risk factor for hypertension. Furthermore, a strong interaction was found between GGT and alcohol consumption on the development of hypertension.4 In this interaction, a positive association between

alcohol consumption and hypertension was observed only in those with high normal GGT level. Among subjects with low GGT level, no matter how much alcohol the subjects drank, the risk of hypertension in drinkers was similar to that of nondrinkers.
Although serum and cellular GGT may not have the same biological meanings, it is interesting to note experimental studies in which GGT at a cellular level plays an important role in antioxidant systems through the maintenance of intracellular levels of glutathione.5–7 Paradoxically, recent studies8–11 have shown that GGT is itself able to play a pro-oxidant role, particularly in the presence of iron.
Emerging evidence suggests that hypertension and type II diabetes share pathophysiological mechanisms, especially oxidative stress.12–15 So, by analogy with type II diabetes, the association between age and hypertension might also depend on GGT level. Therefore, we performed this prospective study with the hypothesis that the relationship between age and hypertension was modified by baseline GGT level.

Materials and methods

This study was based on the same cohort as our previous study of GGT and hypertension. 4 Study design, recruitment of participants, and methods have been described in detail elsewhere.4 Briefly, our study population was 8170 male workers at one steel company in Korea, who were between 25 and 50 years without hypertension (systolic BP (SBP)X140 mmHg, diastolic BP (DBP)X90 mmHg, and/or taking antihypertensive medication) at baseline and examined in both 1994 and 1998 (follow-up rate: 73.7%). No specific informed consent for this study was obtained. Data are analysed pursuant to the Korean health regulation pertaining to factories, which states that the factory physician has an obligation to analyse health examination data to educate workers.
SBP and DBP were recorded oscillometrically with an automatic device (TM-2650A; A&D Company, Japan) in the sitting position after the subjects rested on a chair for 5 min or longer. For employees with SBPX160 mmHg or X95 mmHg, BP were measured again with an ordinary sphygmomanometer by an experienced nurse after another 5 min of rest. Serum GGT concentrations were measured at 371C with an automatic analyzer (normal range 0–50 U/L, Hitachi 7170, Japan).
In this study, 169 men met the definition of hypertension was SBPX160 mmHg or DBPX95 mmHg or under antihypertensive medication. First, we examined the relationship between age (25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–50 years) and SBP or DBP changes within three GGT categories at baseline GGT (0–19, 20–39, X40 U/l) by an analysis of covariance. Next, the relationship between age and incidence of hypertension was examined within the each category of GGT. We performed logistic regression analyses including interaction terms for GGT (0–19, 20–39, X40 U/l) and age (25–34, 35–44, 45–50 years). Covariates were the baseline values of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), cigarette smoking (pack years), alcohol consumption (g/week), exercise (frequency/week), family history of hypertension, either SBP (mmHg) or DBP (mmHg), and the changes in BMI during 4 years. The SAS statistical program, version 8.02, was used in all analyses, the P-values quoted are two-sided, and those values o0.05 are regarded as statistically significant.
Results
Relationships between age and changes in SBP or DBP varied by baseline GGT level. There were stronger dose–response relationships between age and changes in both SBP and DBP for baseline GGT level X40 U/l than for lower GGT levels (Figures 1 and 2) (P for multiplicative interaction, o0.01 for SBP; 0.04 for DBP). In addition, the associations of GGT with both SBP and DBP varied by age. There were positive associations between GGT and

changes in SBP or DBP among those with age X35, whereas there was no association among those with age o35.
The association of age with incidence of hypertension also varied by baseline GGT level. As baseline GGT level increased, the association between age and incidence of hypertension strengthened (P ¼ 0.03 for multiplicative interaction) (Figure 3). Using those aged o35 years and GGT o20 as a reference group, adjusted relative risks for those age o35, 35–44, and X45 years were 1.0, 2.7, 4.5 in those with GGT o20 U/l, 0.6, 3.0, 10.9 in those with GGT between 20 and 39 U/l, and 0.9, 3.9, 19.7 in those with GGTX40 U/l (Table 1). The interaction was similarly observed among nondrinkers, drinkers, and subjects with normal GGT (data not shown). On the other hand, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) did not show any relationship with age in the development of hypertension. For example, adjusted relative risks for those aged X45 years compared to those aged o35 years was 8.8 (unadjusted inci-

Neither exclusion of participants who had abnormal ALT or AST nor additional adjustment for ALT or AST attenuated the associations among incident hypertension, GGT, and age shown in Table 1 and Figure 3.
Discussion
In agreement with our hypothesis, this study found that the association of age with the risk of hypertension varied by baseline GGT level. Among those

with high normal GGT, the effect of age on the development of hypertension was much greater than among those with low GGT. Another way to view the findings of this study is that the effect of GGT on the development of hypertension differed by age. Among young subjects, there was no effect of GGT for the risk of hypertension, whereas among old subjects, GGT showed a strong association. However, other liver enzymes such as ALT or AST did not show a relationship with incident hypertension, suggesting that the association between GGT, age and hypertension is not mediated by liver damage. This finding is consistent with the findings shown in the relationship between age and type II diabetes,1 supporting the concept that underlying mechanisms of hypertension and type II diabetes

(CARDIA) Study
Duk-Hee Lee,1,2 David R. Jacobs, Jr.,2,3* Myron Gross,4 and Michael Steffes4

Background: We hypothesized that serum ␥-glutamyltransferase (GGT) would positively predict the risk of microalbuminuria, a frequent consequence of both diabetes and hypertension, because serum GGT predicted diabetes and hypertension in dose–response relationships. Methods: In this prospective study, 2478 black and white men and women without microalbuminuria at year 10 provided urine samples 5 years later. Year 10 GGT cutpoints were 12, 18, and 29 U/L. Results: The incidence of microalbuminuria across year 10 GGT categories was U-shaped.

Conclusions: Serum GGT within the physiologic range predicted microalbuminuria among patients with hypertension or diabetes and may act as a predictor of microvascular and/or renal complications in these vulnerable groups. GGT showed a U-shaped association with microalbuminuria among persons who did not develop either hypertension or diabetes.

Serum ␥-glutamyltransferase (GGT)5 concentrations within the physiologic range have been strongly associated with most cardiovascular disease risk factors and predicted the development of heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (1– 6 ). In particular, serum GGT concentrations have shown a strong graded relationship with incident diabetes, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes (2, 3 ). Although serum GGT activity has commonly been used as a marker for excessive alcohol consumption or liver diseases (7 ), neither alcohol consumption nor liver dysfunction likely explain the association between serum GGT and diabetes (2, 3 ). A series of Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) studies (3, 8, 9 ) suggested that oxidative stress might explain these associations because serum GGT within the physiologic range had dose–response relationships with serum and/or dietary antioxidant vitamins and markers of oxidative stress such as F2-isoprostanes. Although the relationship between cellular GGT and serum GGT is not known, cellular GGT has been

known to play an important role in antioxidant defense systems (10 –12 ); paradoxically, cellular GGT may also be involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species in the presence of transition metals (13–16 ). Recently, a role of serum GGT as an early and sensitive marker of oxidative stress was reviewed (17 ).
Microalbuminuria, slightly increased albumin excretion in the urine, is now considered to be a predictor of atherosclerotic diseases (18, 19 ). Recent evidence strongly suggested that microalbuminuria is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease in diabetic or hypertensive patients, in elderly patients, and in the general population (18, 19 ). The mechanisms linking microalbuminuria and risk for cardiovascular disease are not fully understood; a recent concept is that microalbuminuria is a marker of endothelial dysfunction (18, 19 ). Generalized endothelial dysfunction has been hypothesized to be the underlying factor for microalbuminuria on the one hand and the underlying factor for increased cardiovascular risk on the other. Accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress alters many functions of the endothelium, including modulation of vasomotor tone (20 ).
We therefore performed a prospective study to examine whether GGT, possibly as a marker of oxidative stress or a generator of oxidative stress itself, is a predictor of microalbuminuria among young adult black and white men and women.
Materials and Methods
study population CARDIA is a longitudinal, multicenter epidemiologic study of the impact of lifestyle and other factors on evolution of coronary heart disease risk factors during young adulthood. The study design, recruitment of participants, and methods have been described elsewhere (21 ). In 1985–1986, at total of 5115 black and white men and women 18 –35 years of age were recruited and examined at 4 clinical sites in the United States: Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; and Oakland, CA. Participants were reexamined at 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years after baseline, with reexamination rates among surviving cohort members of 91%, 86%, 81%, 79%, and 74%, respectively.
In this study, we examined (a) the association between year 0 GGT and microalbuminuria at year 10 or year 15 and (b) the association between year 10 GGT and microalbuminuria at year 15. For this study, a total of 139 persons were excluded because they were pregnant at year 10 or year 15, had any kidney disease at year 10 or year 15, or had macroalbuminuria (A/kC Ն 250mg/g; see below for definition of A/kC) at year 10 or year 15. For the analysis of year 0 GGT in relation to year 10 or 15 microalbuminuria, we excluded 61 study participants in whom GGT was not measured at year 0 and 1038 who dropped out before year 10 or who did not provide a urine sample at both year 10 and 15, leaving 3895 participants. For the analysis of year 10 GGT in relation to year

15 microalbuminuria, among 3817 participants who attended a year 10 examination, we excluded 75 in whom GGT was not measured at year 10, 1116 who did not return for a year 15 follow-up examination or who did not provide a urine sample at either year 10 or 15 measurements, and 263 who had prevalent microalbuminuria at year 10, leaving 2478 participants for analysis. In both sets of analyses, some individuals satisfied more than 1 exclusion criterion.
questionnaires Standard questionnaires were used to maintain consistency in the assessment of demographic and behavioral information across CARDIA examination visits. Sex, race, date of birth, weekly alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking were determined by structured interview or by self-administered questionnaire. A physical activity score was derived from the CARDIA Physical Activity History, a simplified version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (22 ). Alcohol intake (mL/day) was computed from the self-reported frequency of beer, wine, and liquor consumed per week.
clinical measurements All participants were asked to fast at least 12 h and to avoid smoking and heavy physical activity at least 2 h before the examination. After a 5-min rest, blood pressure was measured on the right arm in the sitting position. First- and fifth-phase Korotkoff sounds were recorded 3 times at 1-min intervals by use of a random zero sphygmomanometer (WA Baum Company). The mean of the second and third measurements was used in the analyses. Blood was then collected, with minimal stasis, for GGT and glucose. After plasma or serum separation, aliquots were stored at Ϫ70 °C until shipped on dry ice to a central laboratory.
The methods for measuring serum GGT were not comparable between year 0 and year 10. At year 0, liver-related enzymes, including GGT, were measured with a SMAC 12 continuous-flow analyzer (Technicon Instruments Corp.) at American Bio-science Laboratories (now Smith-Kline Beecham). At year 10, GGT was measured colorimetrically by a nitroanilide methodology at Linco Research Inc. Therefore, to identify an appropriate recalibration formula, GGT was remeasured at Linco Research Inc. with the year 10 methodology in 103 baseline samples with original GGT values ranging from 3 to 228 U/L that had been stored at Ϫ70 °C for 17 years (since 1985–1986). The correlation between measurements made at year 0 and those measured with year 10 methodology was 0.995; accordingly, the year 0 values reported here are 2.7618 plus 1.9004 times the original year 0 values. Year 0 and year 10 glucose was measured by the hexokinaseultraviolet method at Linco, Inc. Year 0 and year 10 lipids were measured by the University of Washington Northwest Lipid Research Clinic Laboratory. Total triglycerides and total HDL-cholesterol were measured by enzymatic

methods. HDL-cholesterol was measured after dextran sulfate–magnesium precipitation. LDL-cholesterol was calculated by use of the Friedewald equation. Body weight with light clothing was measured to the nearest 0.09 kg (0.2 pounds), and body height without shoes was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm. Body mass index was computed as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2).
measurement of urine albumin and creatinine A single, untimed (spot) urine sample was collected at the year 10 examination when convenient during the clinic visit, usually shortly after arrival at the clinic. Albumin (A) and creatinine (C) were measured, and the term A/kC adjusted for race and gender bias, which was reported previously (23 ). Urinary creatinine concentration (mg/ dL) in men was multiplied by k ϭ 0.68 (23, 24 ) and in blacks by k ϭ 0.88; the constant in black men is therefore 0.68 ϫ 0.88 (23, 25 ). Applying these adjustments allowed the use of 25 mg/g A/kC as the cutpoint for microalbuminuria in each of the 4 race– gender groups of CARDIA (23 ).
statistical analysis Year 0 serum GGT concentrations were first classified into 4 groups based on cutpoints of 12, 18, and 26 U/L (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles computed over the entire sample) for study of GGT as a predictor of microalbuminuria 10 or 15 years later. Because there was no earlier measure of microalbuminuria, we could not be sure that all cases were incident; we will therefore use the term “prevalent microalbuminuria” for this analysis. Logistic regression models were used to calculate multivariateadjusted odd ratios (ORs). Covariates in the minimally adjusted model were the values of study center, sex, race, and baseline age. The second model added baseline body mass index, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, physical exercise, and education. The third model added LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. Given the strong possibility that diabetes and hypertension are intermediate in the causal pathway between GGT and microalbuminuria (26 ), we examined associations

after stratification by status of diabetes or hypertension (never experiencing diabetes or hypertension during follow-up compared with having diabetes or hypertension during follow-up). The definition of diabetes incidence was serum fasting glucose Ն1260 mg/L or taking diabetes medication, and the definition of hypertension was systolic blood pressure Ն140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure Ն90 mmHg, or the use of antihypertensive medication. In tests for trend, the quartile number of the serum GGT value was treated as a continuous variable.
We next examined the shorter term risk of GGT measured at year 10 when participants were 28 – 40 years of age. Year 10 serum GGT cutpoints of 12, 18, and 29 U/L (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles computed over the entire sample) and year 10 values of all covariates were used for study of association of year 10 GGT with year 15 incident microalbuminuria (omitting participants who had microalbuminuria at year 10).
Results
year 0 ggt and year 10 or 15 prevalent microalbuminuria The risk of prevalent microalbuminuria was increased in the highest quartile of year 0 GGT (Table 1). After minimal adjustment for study center, race, sex, and age, the ORs of year 10 or year 15 prevalent microalbuminuria across quartiles of year 0 GGT were 1.0, 0.97, 1.02, and 1.82 (model 1; P Ͻ0.01 for trend; P Ͻ0.01 for quadratic term). After further adjustment for alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, physical activity, education, body mass index, education, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, the ORs were 1.0, 0.93, 0.92, and 1.44 (P ϭ 0.03 for trend; P ϭ 0.01 for quadratic term).
The shape of association, however, depended on the status of hypertension or diabetes (P Ͻ0.01 for interaction). Among the 777 participants who ever had either hypertension or diabetes, the distribution of first diagnosis was 14.0% at year 0, 6.1% at year 2, 10.3% at year 5, 10.6% at year 7, 18.9% at year 10, and 40.2% at year 15. Thus, 59% of the diagnoses of hypertension or diabetes were seen at year 10 or later. Of the participants with

hypertension, 43.9% took antihypertensive medication, and 21.4% of participants took antidiabetes medication. Among participants who ever had hypertension or diabetes, the association between year 0 GGT and year 10 or 15 prevalent microalbuminuria was positive in a dose– response pattern, even after full adjustment (Table 2); adjusted ORs across quartiles of serum GGT were 1.0, 1.08, 1.50, and 1.94 (P ϭ 0.02 for trend). Separate analyses for participants with diabetes but no hypertension and those with hypertension but no diabetes had results very similar to those for participants with either diabetes or hypertension (data not shown). However, among participants with neither hypertension nor diabetes during the study, year 0 GGT showed a shallow, nonsignificant, U-shaped association; adjusted ORs across quartiles of serum GGT were 1.0, 0.94, 0.80, 1.05 (P ϭ 0.26 for quadratic term).
year 10 ggt and year 15 incident microalbuminuria Year 10 serum GGT showed a clear U-shaped association with year 15 incident microalbuminuria (Table 3; P Ͻ0.01 for quadratic term in all models). The risk of incident microalbuminuria among participants in the second or third quartile of GGT was less than one-half of that in the lowest year 10 GGT quartile. Similar with year 0 serum GGT, the shape of association was different depending on the status of hypertension or diabetes (P Ͻ0.01 for interaction). Among participants with neither hypertension nor diabetes during the study, year 10 GGT also showed a U-shaped association with year 15 incident microalbuminuria (Table 4). However, among participants who ever had hypertension or diabetes, the association between

year 10 GGT and year 15 incident microalbuminuria was positive in a dose–response pattern. The short-term relative risk (between year 10 GGT and year 15 incident microalbuminuria) appeared to be stronger than the longterm relative risk (year 0 GGT and year 10 or 15 prevalent microalbuminuria) irrespective of the shape of association, linear or U-shaped.
Discussion
We performed this study with the hypothesis that serum GGT concentrations within the physiologic range positively predict future development of microalbuminuria because serum GGT has been strongly associated with most cardiovascular disease risk factors and predicted the development of heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (1– 6 ). However, in general, the shape of association between serum GGT and microalbuminuria was closer to a U-shaped association than a linear positive association. This finding was much clearer in the association between year 10 GGT and year 15 incident microalbuminuria than in the association between year 0 GGT and year 10 or 15 prevalent microalbuminuria.
Interestingly, the shape of association was clearly different depending on the status of hypertension or diabetes. Consistent with our previous hypothesis, serum GGT was positively associated with microalbuminuria among participants who were ever diagnosed with hypertension or diabetes during the 15 years of study. Also similar to our finding predicting diabetes in a previous CARDIA study (3 ), the 5-year short-term risk of serum GGT was stronger than the 10- to 15-year long-term risk of serum GGT. However, serum GGT showed a U-shaped association with microalbuminuria among participants with nei-

ther hypertension nor diabetes during the study, especially in the 5-year short-term risk. These different findings by status of hypertension or diabetes may have arisen by chance, particularly given the small numbers of participants who were both in the lowest quartile of serum GGT and had either hypertension or diabetes, but this seems unlikely in light of the high degree of statistical significance for the positive trends seen among hypertensive or diabetic participants and for the U-shape for 5-year risk of incident microalbuminuria starting with year 10 GGT.
In this study, we used a single, untimed spot urine sample for measurement of albumin in urine. This may have led to some participants being misclassified; generally, nondifferential misclassification leads to a null association rather than a spurious association. If we had used a more rigorous design with urine samples collected over

24 h or collected in the first morning urine, we might have expected stronger associations.
We speculate that the current findings are interpretable from the perspective of the cellular role of GGT, which may connect serum GGT to oxidative stress. Although the relationship between cellular GGT and serum GGT is not known, experimental studies have shown that cellular GGT activity plays a role in maintaining intracellular glutathione (GSH) as an antioxidant defense mechanism (10 –12 ). Cellular GGT is widely distributed in the human body and is frequently localized to the plasma membrane with its active site directed into the extracellular space (27 ). The highest activity was in the kidneys, where GGT was localized to the luminal surface of the proximal tubule cells; the distal tubules and glomeruli gave negative results. Although serum GGT is known as one of the liver enzymes, cellular GGT activity in homogenates of

liver was approximately one-fifth that in kidney. The primary role of GGT ectoactivity is to metabolize extracellular reduced GSH, allowing precursor amino acids to be assimilated and reutilized for intracellular GSH synthesis; in this way, a continuous “GSH cycling” across the plasma membrane occurs in many cell types (28 ). Thus, cellular GGT favors the intracellular supply of GSH, the most important nonprotein antioxidant of the cell, suggesting that increased serum GGT activity might eventually minimize oxidative stress and the consequent pathologic changes attributable to oxidative stress. Small increases in serum GGT might therefore reflect a successful defense response and, particularly in the short run (e.g., 5 years, second and third quartiles of year 10 GGT), might lead to less endothelial dysfunction and microalbuminuria than would have been the case if the GGT concentration had remained low (first quartile of year 10 GGT). However, larger increases in serum GGT suggest an environment in which there is more oxidative stress, in which the primary role of GGT in the antioxidant defense of cells might be overwhelmed, leading to a U-shaped association.
However, recent experimental studies (13–16 ) indicate that cellular GGT can also be involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species. This effect of cellular GGT occurs when it is produced in the presence of free iron or other transition metals. In vitro experimental studies have reported that free iron can be released from iron storage proteins such as ferritin by superoxide radicals or nitric oxide (29 –31 ). It is well known that substantial oxidative stress exists in diabetes (32, 33 ) and hypertension (34, 35 ). Therefore, patients with diabetes or hypertension might have a potential to have free iron released from iron storage protein, and in this case, cellular GGT might act as a prooxidant.
In conclusion, this study showed that serum GGT within the physiologic range was differently associated with the risk of microalbuminuria depending on the status of diabetes or hypertension. We speculate that these complicated associations might be related to the dual roles of cellular GGT as antioxidant or prooxidant, depending on the presence of iron or other transition metals.

Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels, cerebrovascular risk factors, and distribution of cerebral infarct areas in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients and Methods. Sixty patients with AIS and 44 controls who had not cerebrovascular disease were included in the study. The patients were divided into four groups according to the location of the infarct area and evaluated as for GGT levels and the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and hyperlipidemia (HL). Results. The frequency of DM, HT, and HL and gender distributions were similar. The mean GGT levels were significantly higher in patients with AIS and those with relatively larger areas of infarction ( < 0.05). Increased mean GGT levels were found in the subgroup with hypertension, higher LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels among cases with AIS ( < 0.05). Conclusion. Higher GGT levels in AIS patients reinforce the relationship of GGT with inflammation and oxidative stress. The observation of higher GGT levels in patients with relatively larger areas of infarction is indicative of a positive correlation between increases in infarct areas and elevated GGT levels.

1. Introduction
Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) mediates intracellular intake of extracellular glutathione which is an important component of antioxidant mechanisms. Glutathione is produced during normal metabolic processes and plays an important role in the protection of cells against oxidative stress. GGT has been used for years as an index of hepatic dysfunction and marker of alcohol use [1, 2]. In populationbased studies, after exclusion of alcohol consumption, a positive correlation has been demonstrated between higher GGT levels and advanced age, male gender, increases in body mass index (BMI), smoking, sedentary life style, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, increased LDL-cholesterol, and decreased HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertriglyceridemia, menopause, and oral contraceptive use [3, 4].
In this study, our aim was to investigate the relationship between serum GGT levels and several risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and also distribution of cerebral infarct areas in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

2. Material and Method
Sixty patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of AIS and 44 CVD-na¨ıve individuals who consulted to neurology polyclinic for other reasons were investigated. Patients with a history of chronic liver or renal disease, endocrine, and autoimmune diseases other than diabetes, alcoholics, smokers, those who had undergone surgical interventions related to coronary, carotid, or extremity arteries, or users of drugs which might alter GGT test results (lipid-lowering drugs, antibiotics) were excluded from the study. However diabetic and/or hypertensive patients continued to use the drugs for regulation of their glycemic state and blood pressure levels. The patients with newly onset angina, myocardial infarction, and advanced heart failure were not enrolled in the study. Levels of liver enzymes, bilirubin, and hepatic markers of all cases were within normal limits. Blood samples of AIS patients were obtained within twenty-four hours after stroke.
According to Bamford classification, stroke patients were divided into 4 groups based on the infarct area as total

anterior circulation infarcts (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarcts (PACI), lacunar infarcts (LACI), and posterior circulation infarcts (POCI). In the patient and the control groups, study participants were evaluated as for the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), hyperlipidemia (HL), and alterations in serum GGT levels. GGT was analyzed using a spectrophotometric method, and values ranging between 7 and 60 U/L were considered to be within physiologic limits.
In the statistical analysis Student’s -test, independent samples -test, Mann Whitney  test, chi-square test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed. The significance level was evaluated at  < 0.05.
3. Results
Demographic data are seen in Table 1. A significant difference was not found between groups regarding mean ages and gender distribution. The frequencies of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia in the cases with AIS and controls were comparable (88.3 versus 88.6%, 38.3 versus 38.6%, and 36.6 versus 40.9%, resp.). Mean GGT level in the AIS group was found to be significantly higher relative to the control group (23.3 ± 11.8 versus 15.0 ± 5.7 IU/L;  < 0.000). The cut-off value for GGT was calculated as 26.4 IU/L. Mean GGT level in the AIS group did not differ between female and male cases (23.1±13.9 versus 23.5±9.9 IU/L, resp.;  > 0.05). The lowest and the highest GGT levels were detected in the LACI and PACI groups, respectively. Mean GGT levels were significantly higher in TACI, PACI, and POCI groups than in LACI group (Table 2). Increased GGT level was found in the subgroup with hypertension, higher LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels among cases with AIS (Table 3).
4. Discussion
Although gamma-glutamyl transferase is mostly found within cytosoles, it is also present on cellular membrane in considerable amounts and plays a role in intracellular ingress of amino acids and peptides in the form of -glutamyl peptides. Glutathione is its most important substrate. This tripeptide is a thiol derivative which is the most important nonprotein intracellular component and functions as a primary

determinant of cellular redox mechanisms. In conditions giving rise to cellular stress, intracellular glutathione levels decrease. Decreased intracellular glutathione levels induce formation of GGT enzyme so as to maintain preexisting levels. Increased oxidative stress enhances requirement for glutathione. In the presence of inadequate amounts of glutathione, oxidative stress exerts more harmful effects [5–7]. The mechanism of the relationship between cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors and GGT level is not fully known. According to a currently entertained theory, oxidative stress and related decrease in glutathione levels induce

activity of GGT. Independent of alcohol consumption and presence of a liver disease, the predictive role of GGT activity in the development of new cases of diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic stroke has been established [8–12].
The Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Program (VHM&PP) study conducted by Ruttmann et al. in Austria is the largest scale prospective study performed up to date [13]. This epidemiologic study has investigated the association between GGT and cardiovascular mortality. In this survey study an independent but significant association between GGT levels and cardiovascular mortality in both female and male cohorts was found. In the male patient cohort, a significant correlation between GGT and cardiovascular disease and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke was present. In the same study, the correlation between GGT and cardiovascular disease was observed, but a statistically significant correlation between GGT levels and stroke (both hemorrhagic and ischemic types) could not be detected. Besides, prognostic significance of GGT was more prominently observed in patients younger than 60 years of age. Also in our study GGT levels were statistically significantly higher in the ischemic stroke group relative to the control group. However distribution of increased GGT values in the female and male patient groups did not differ significantly.
A multicenter prospective epidemiologic study (CARDIA, The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) investigated 5115 individuals aged between 17 and 35 years. CARDIA study revealed correlations among normal GGT levels, diabetes, and hypertension [14]. The investigators also reported potential role of oxidative stress as a risk factor for the development of diabetes and hypertension and concluded that GGT is a sensitive early stage predictor of oxidative stress. In our study, a statistically significant difference was not observed between patients with or without diabetes; however, significant increases in GGT levels were noted in hypertensive patients. Besides significantly higher GGT levels were detected in patients with increased LDLcholesterol and triglyceride levels.
D’Ambrosio et al. reported that increased gammaglutamyl transferase levels predict functional impairment in elderly adults after ischemic stroke [15]. Korantzopoulos et al. also found positive correlation between serum gammaglutamyl transferase and acute ischemic nonembolic stroke in the elderly subjects [16]. The role played by oxidative stress, subclinical inflammation in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases, and development of stroke is already acknowledged. Mechanisms related to oxidative stress and subclinical inflammation can account for the role of GGT in the development of cerebrovascular disease [5, 17–20]. Increased GGT levels can play a pathogenetic role in the evolution and instability of atherosclerotic plaques in different vascular regions [21].
In our study, significantly higher GGT levels were detected in the AIS group relative to the control group. Besides, statistically significantly higher levels of GGT in cases with hypertension, increased LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels suggest the role of oxidative stress. GGT might increase secondary to arterial wall inflammation and

resultant arterial wall thickening, and higher GGT levels might protect arterial wall against oxidative stress as well.
In conclusion, higher GGT levels in AIS patients relative to the control group reinforce the relationship of GGT with inflammation and oxidative stress. Detection of relatively higher levels of GGT in AIS patients with hypertension, increased LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels indicates the presence of a positive correlation between GGT levels, oxidative stress, and inflammation. When compared with the LACI group of patients with relatively smaller lacunar infarcts, observation of higher GGT levels in TACI, PACI, and POCI groups with relatively larger areas is indicative of a positive correlation between increases in infarct areas and elevated GGT levels. Future studies can better reveal the possible role of GGT in the prediction of oxidative stress and mild degrees of chronic inflammation.

Transpeptidase

Levels and Hypertension:

Common in Drinkers and Nondrinkers

A significant association between elevations of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (y-GTP) levels and those of blood pressure and hypertension has been reported separately in drinkers and nondrinkers. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the relationship between serum y-GTP and the prevalence of hypertension is the same or similar in both drinkers and nondrinkers. The study subjects com-
prised 4,920 male nondrinkers, 9,390 male daily drinkers, 8,081 female nondrinkers, and 278 female daily drinkers, who were aged 40 to 59 years. The prevalence of hypertension in the male and female daily drinkers was 1.5 and 1.3 times, respectively, higher than in the nondrinkers. Mean systolic blood pressure in the male and female drinkers was 4.4 and 3.1 mmHg, respectively, higher than in the nondrinkers. After adjusting for age, body mass index, and serum y-GTP levels, the differences in the prevalence of hypertension and the mean systolic blood pressure level between the drinkers and nondrinkers decreased to 1.2 times and 2.7 mmHg, respectively. Although these small differences remained statistically significant, the association between serum y-GTP and hypertension appears to be quite similar in both drinkers and nondrinkers, suggesting that hepatic steatosis may play a common, pathogenetic role in the development of hypertension. (Hypertens Res 1995; 18: 295-301)
Key words: serum y-glutamyl transpeptidase, hypertension, alcohol, obesity, hepatic steatosis

A large number of epidemiological studies have confirmed an association between the volume of
alcohol consumed and blood pressure levels (1, 2). The reliability of the reported alcohol consumption
data in epidemiological studies has been questioned, but a close association between the level of serum
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (y-GTP), which is a well-known biological indicator of alcohol consumption, and blood pressure has also been
observed by many researchers (3-7). The mechanism underlying the elevation of y -
GTP in the sera of alcohol consumers has been debated, but hepatic cell-membrane damage (8-10),
rather than enzyme-induction (10, 11), has been suggested to be the major mechanism. The association of serum y-GTP with blood pressure elevations in alcohol consumers was also suggested to be a
reflection of hepatic cell damage rather than enzyme induction, since serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is elevated in alcoholic liver
disease but not induced in the liver cells (12, 13), also showed an association with blood pressure in
alcohol consumers (14). The hepatic cell damage must be related to hepatic steatosis since it is the
earliest liver manifestation in alcohol consumers
(15, 16).

On the other hand, a significant association of serum y-GTP with blood pressure and hypertension has been found even in nondrinkers (17-19). In
people without a drinking habit, elevations of serum
y-GTP, as well as those of other serum hepatic enzymes such as asparate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are thought to
reflect the progression of hepatic steatosis with increasing body weight (20, 21). Hepatic steatosis may play an important role in the development of
insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, resulting in hypertension (22, 23).
These previous findings suggest that elevations of serum y -GTP levels, which could be a reflection of hepatic steatosis, may relate to blood pressure
elevations and hypertension in both alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers. However, drinkers and nondrinkers have been evaluated for the relationship sepa-
rately, and the similarity of the relationship has not been fully evaluated. In the present study, we com-
pared the relationship between serum y-GTP levels and blood pressure and hypertension in middle-aged men and women who consumed alcohol or did not
to determine if that the relationship is similar in alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers.

Methods
Male and female subjects, who were between 40 to 59 years of age and either consumed alcohol or did not, were recruited from among all participants in this age group, (21,873 men and 10,449 women) who underwent a health screening program conducted by an occupational health service facility during the one-year period of 1992. The participants who stated in a self-report questionnaire that they had not drunk at all, or had drunk only a small volume ( < 10 ml) of alcohol not more often than once a month during the preceding one-year period, were regarded as essentially nondrinkers.
On the other hand, the participants who had drunk alcoholic beverages almost every day were defined as daily drinkers. The male nondrinkers and daily drinkers numbered 4,920 and 9,390, respectively, and the female nondrinkers and daily drinkers 8,081 and 278, respectively. The remaining 9,653 male and female participants who had drunk alcoholic beverages sometimes but not every day, and thus had consumed a smaller volume than the daily drinkers, were excluded from the present study to facilitate comparison between the nondrinkers and daily drinkers.
In the health screening program, body weight was measured with only the jacket removed, and the value of body weight was determined as the measured weight minus 1 kg. Blood pressure was measured once using an automatic oscillometric monitor, BP-103N (Nippon Colin, Japan), following the recommendations of the Japanese Association for Cerebro-cardiovascular Disease Control for the mass screening of hypertension using automatic equipment (24, 25). Namely, blood pressure was measured after the subjects had rested on a chair for five minutes or longer, using cuffs 13 cm wide and 24 cm long. After the measurement of blood
pressure, fasting venous blood was obtained from the cubital vein, and serum y -GTP level was determined using an automatic analyzer, Hitachi 7250
(Hitachi, Japan). The subjects were divided into four categories of

body mass index (BMI: kg/m2): slender (BMI <20 kg/m2), medium (20-24 kg/m2), overweight (25-27 kg/m2), and obese (BMI> 28 kg/m2). The subjects were then divided into five categories of serum y GTP levels: less than 15, 15 to 29, 30 to 59, 60 to 119, and above 120 U/l. This categorization of serum y-GTP level was based on the fact that the
geometric mean value of serum y-GTP in the male participants aged 40 to 59 years in the health checkups was around 30 U/l, and the geometric standard deviation was 2.0.
The prevalence of hypertension was calculated in each of the categories, and compared among the different categories of serum y -GTP levels for each category of BMI in both drinkers and nondrinkers, and in both men and women. Hypertension was defined here as being present in persons who showed blood pressure levels above 160/95 mmHg at the health check-ups or those being treated with hy-
potensive agents. After excluding the subjects receiving hypotensive agents, the means of blood
pressure were then compared among the categories. The differences in the relationships of serum y -
GTP to the prevalence of hypertension or to blood
pressure levels between drinkers and nondrinkers, and between men and women, after adjusting for age and BMI, were statistically evaluated by a multiple logistic regression analysis and a generalized linear model analysis. These statistical analyses were performed using an SAS program package distributed by SAS Japan for a personal computer, PC-98 RL (NEC, Japan) . Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
Results
Means and standard deviations of age, BMI, serum
y-GTP, and blood pressure in the male and female subjects with or without alcohol consumption are shown in Table 1. Geometric means and geometric standard deviations were obtained for serum yGTP levels. The means of all these variables were significantly higher in the men than in the women. Mean age and BMI were 1.3 year and 0.3 kg/m2 respectively higher in the men than in the women.

Table 2. Numbers of Middle-Aged and Serum y-GTP Levels

Men and Women with or without Alcohol Consumption

According to Body Mass Size

The geometric mean of serum y -GTP was 1.5 times
higher in the men than in the women. Differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the
men and women were 5.9 and 4.8 mmHg, respectively.
On the other hand, there were no significant differences in age and BMI between the drinkers and nondrinkers, either in the men or women. How-
ever, geometric means of serum y-GTP in the men and women with alcohol consumption were 1.7 and 1.5 times, respectively, higher than in those without
alcohol consumption. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in the male drinkers were 4.4 and 3.4 mmHg, respectively, higher than those in
the male nondrinkers. Respective differences between the female drinkers and nondrinkers were 3.1 and 2.1 mmHg.
Although not shown in the table, the prevalence of hypertension in the combined total of male and
female subjects was 16.6 and 10.6%, respectively,
i.e. 1.6 times more prevalent in men as compared to women. Hypertension was found in 626 of 4,920 male nondrinkers (12.7%) but in 1,748 of 9,390
male drinkers (18.6%), and in 844 of 8,081 female nondrinkers (10.4%) and 38 of 278 female drinkers
(13.7%). Thus, hypertension in men and women with alcohol consumption was 1.5 and 1.3 times, respectively, more frequent than in those without it.
The numbers of male and female subjects with or
without alcohol consumption in each category of BMI and serum y -GTP are shown in Table 2. In
women, the numbers of subjects with higher serum
yr-iGnkTePrs.levTehluss,wethree spmreavlal lienncbeosthofnhoynpderrinteknesrisonanind d
each of the categories are summarized in Table 3, excluding the categories with numbers less than ten
in women. The prevalences of hypertension were increased with increased BMI, but were higher at
higher serum y-GTP levels at all levels of body

mass size, in both drinkers and nondrinkers, and in both men and women.
The mean of blood pressure was then calculated
in each of the categories, after excluding the sub-
jects being treated with hypotensive agents. Table 4 shows the mean systolic blood pressure levels in the male and female subjects with or without alcohol consumption according to body mass size and serum
y-GTP levels. The mean values were elevated with increased BMI, but were also higher at higher
serum y-GTP levels. Similar results were obtained for diastolic blood pressure, although not shown in the table.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of hypertension with the variables of age, BMI, and serum y-GTP
levels, separately in the male and female drinkers and nondrinkers. All three variables were signi-
ficantly related to the prevalence of hypertension in both sexes and in both drinkers and nondrinkers.
The results of the analysis including sex and the difference in alcohol consumption as independent vari-
ables are shown in Table 5. Among daily drinkers the odds ratio of hypertension was 1.24 as com-
pared with nondrinkers; and among female daily d rinkers the odds ratio of hypertension was 1.24 as compared with male daily drinkers, which meant
that the prevalence of hypertension among male

Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme present in serum and on most cell surfaces and serves as an oxidative stress marker. Although serum GGT is associated with hypertension development, little data are available on the associations between GGT and hypertension among populations with diabetes mellitus (DM). Our aim was to investigate the potential association between the changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure (SBP/ DBP) and the GGT level in type 2 DM subjects, in comparison with non-DM subjects. In 179 non-DM and 177 DM subjects, SBP/DBP, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, serum asparate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and GGT were measured at the baseline and after a 1-year period. Between these 2-measurement points, in non-DM subjects, SBP and DBP levels were significantly increased, while GGT tended to increase. In contrast, in DM subjects, the mean levels of SBP, DBP and GGT remained unchanged. Multivariate analysis revealed that in non-DM subjects the degree of increase in SBP was significantly and positively correlated to that of GGT (β = 0.165), along with age and BMI. Likewise, the increase in DBP was correlated to that of GGT in non-DM subjects (β = 0.170). In contrast, in DM subjects, the degree of increase in SBP was significantly correlated to that of only GGT (β = 0.166). These results suggest that the presence of DM may attenuate the effects of GGT on DBP. ──── liver enzyme; gammaglutamyl transferase; body mass index; weight change. Tohoku J. Exp.

Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme that is present in serum and on the surfaces of most cell types, and serum GGT is clinically used as a marker of alcohol consumption in general. Recently, serum GGT has been recognized

as a marker of oxidative stress (OS) (Lee et al. 2004). Although the mechanism on the associations between GGT and OS remains largely unknown, some possible explanations exist: e.g., its direct involvement in the generation of reac-

tive oxygen species, its indirect role to maintain intracellular antioxidant glutathione (in a response to OS, increased transport of glutathione into cells by increased GGT activity), its relation to chronic inflammation, or its relation to the pathophysiology of insulin resistance (Lee et al. 2003; Shankar and Li 2007).
OS is involved in the pathophysiology of various diseases such as cardiovascular and/or metabolic regulation (Lee et al. 2004). In fact, increased serum GGT levels are implicated in an increased blood pressure (BP) and the progression of hypertension (HT) (Nilssen et al. 1990; Ikai et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2002, 2003; Stranges et al. 2005; Shankar and Li 2007). However, little data have been available on the associations between GGT and HT among populations with diabetes mellitus (DM) specifically, still more data regarding GGT change levels (over a period of at least 1 year to see a chronic influence) are needed. DM and HT are interrelated diseases predisposing to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: OS-related mechanisms can be hypothesized in this interrelationship (Lee et al. 2003). Accordingly, the association between GGT and BP levels among DM populations may have some specific characteristics, but there are not any data with a comparison to non-DM populations.
With these backgrounds in mind, we conducted a 1-year observational study to investigate the following outcome-of-interest: whether systolic/diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) level differences could be potentially associated with those of GGT in addition to other hepatic enzymes in type 2 DM subjects, and whether the association between BP and GGT was different between type 2 DM and non-DM subjects.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
In total, 356 asymptomatic Japanese subjects were studied during a 1-year study period between 2006 and 2007: there were 179 non-DM subjects (79 males and 100 females; mean age: 48.7 ± 6.2 [range: 36-64] years) and 177 type 2 DM subjects (78 males and 99 females; mean: 50.5 ± 6.5 [35-65] years). This study was approved by the Tottori University Ethics Committee and each subject gave informed consent. These subjects were

recruited from a general population for health check-ups. Type 2 DM was diagnosed through repeated doctor’s checks for subjects with plasma glucose (PG) of ≧ 7 mmol/l (World Health Organization criteria) in blood examinations both at the baseline and after a 1-year study period. Non-DM subjects showed persistent normal PG levels in similar examinations, and were apparently of normal health.
All subjects had had no medical history of cardiovascular, thyroid, renal or malignant disorders. They were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody, had serum levels less than 2-folds the upper limit of the reference range of each hepatic enzyme, did not take any continuous medication, and had not had an alcohol intake and smoking habits. They were untreated during the study period. For each subject, seated SBP/DBP was measured 3-times with an automatic electronic sphygmomanometer (BP-103i II; Nippon Colin, Komaki) and the 3 measurements were averaged. At the baseline, in addition to SBP/DBP and body mass index (BMI), fasting PG, serum asparate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and GGT were measured. After the 1-year period, the same variables were reexamined. PG was assayed with an automatic analyzer (JCA-BM2250, JEOL Co. Ltd., Tokyo), and AST, ALT and GGT were also assayed with an automatic analyzer (TBA-200FR, Toshiba, Tokyo). These intraassay-coefficients of variation were 0.8% in PG, 0.5% in AST, 0.5% in ALT and 0.6% in GGT, respectively.
All values were expressed as mean ± S.D. (regarding AST, ALT and GGT, geometric mean). Level differences between the data at the baseline and after a 1-year period were analyzed by paired t-test. A multiple regression analysis on level differences of SBP/DBP was used to analyze the correlation to those of GGT after adjusting for measured confounders (age, gender, BMI, AST and ALT). Because of their skewed distributions, AST, ALT and GGT were log-transformed and included in the analysis model. We used SBP/DBP as continuous variables and gender simply as an explanatory variable, since no threshold effects of GGT on BP levels and no clear gender-differences in the association between GGT and BP have been confirmed (Shankar and Li 2007). A level of p < 0.05 was considered significant.

variable in the non-DM and type 2 DM group were respectively listed in Table 1. During a 1-year period, in non-DM subjects, SBP and DBP levels were significantly increased, while GGT slightly increased. In contrast, in type 2 DM subjects, the mean levels of SBP, DBP and GGT remained unchanged.
In non-DM subjects, the degree of increase in SBP was significantly, independently and posi-

tively correlated to that of GGT, along with age and BMI (Table 2). Similarly, DBP were significantly, independently and positively correlated to GGT. On the other hand, in type 2 DM subjects, the degree of increase in SBP was significantly, independently and positively correlated to that of only GGT. Although a correlated tendency to GGT was observed, DBP did not show any relative significance.

DISCUSSION
Our study during a 1-year period found a significant and positive association between GGT and SBP level differences, but DBP, in a population of type 2 DM, independent of age, gender, BMI and other hepatic enzymes. This finding extends to type 2 DM in that GGT may be a predictive biochemical marker at least for SBP changes. Notably, the impact of measured variables on SBP/DBP might be different between type 2 DM and non-DM: while in non-DM, the effects of age and BMI on SBP and the associations of GGT with both SBP and DBP are in lines with prior reports (Nilssen et al. 1990; Ikai et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2002, 2003; Whelton et al. 2002; Stranges et al. 2005; Shankar and Li 2007), lack of age- or BMI-related effects and attenuation on the association of GGT with DBP, observed in

type 2 DM, may be reflective of some specific pathophysiology of type 2 DM. Because DM is usually found together with OS (Ceriello 2006), the presence of OS may modify GGT functions unlike those in non-DM subjects. Furthermore, for example, premature aging or weight reduction, which is linked with OS, is known during the progression of DM (Preuss 1997; Wakabayashi and Masuda 2004), and this may partly explain our results on type 2 DM.
In summary, our study showed a positive association between GGT and SBP level differences in type 2 DM, similar to non-DM. However, the impact of GGT on measured variables including DBP among type 2 DM subjects can be different from that of non-DM subjects, suggesting that the presence of DM may attenuate the effects of GGT on increases in DBP. These results call for further study.

Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity is a general clinical marker of excessive alcohol consumption, and GGT reflects changes in oxidative stress and implicated in the progression of hypertension. Recent guidelines classify persons with above-optimal blood pressure (BP) but not clinical hypertension as having prehypertension for a systolic BP (SBP) of 120 to 139 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP (DBP) of 80 to 89 mmHg; however, only limited data are available on the association between serum GGT and this entity among community-dwelling men in Japan. We performed a cross-sectional study to examine whether serum GGT was associated with prehypertension. Study participants (754 men, age 56 ± 15 years) without a clinical history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, angina, or renal failure were recruited from a single community. Thirty-seven percent of participants had prehypertension and 39.3% had hypertension. Multiple regression analysis using SBP and DBP as objective variables, adjusted for risk factors as explanatory variables, showed that log GGT was significantly and independently associated with elevated SBP (β = 0.109, P = 0.006) and DBP (β = 0.238, P < 0.001). Compared with participants in the lowest tertile of serum GGT (< 29 IU/L), the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) for prehypertension was 1.73 (1.06-2.81) for the middle tertile (29-53 IU/L) and 2.37 (1.31-4.31) for the highest tertile (> 53 IU/L). Moreover, the respective ORs for hypertension were 1.82 (1.04-3.18) and 3.11 (1.61-6.03). These results suggest that higher serum GGT levels are associated with prehypertension or hypertension in the general male population. ──── gamma-glutamyl transferase; hypertension; prehypertension; risk factor; Japanese men.

Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a general clinical marker of alcohol consumption, although it is documented that other factors are also associated with serum levels of GGT. Serum GGT activity reflects changes in oxidative

stress, perhaps via a direct role for GGT in generating reactive oxygen species (Lee et al. 2004; Lim et al. 2004) and an indirect role in increasing the transport of glutathione precursors into cells. Thus, several large epidemiological studies have

shown that elevated GGT levels are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). (Lee et al. 2006; Meisinger et al. 2006; Shankar et al. 2007), whereas other have demonstrated that GGT reflects other concomitant risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes (Lee et al. 2003), hypertension (Shanklar and Li 2007), dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (Lee et al. 2007).
Hypertension is one of the most common diseases in Japan and is strongly associated with an increased risk of CVD. Increased CVD mortality risk occurs when blood pressure (BP) is as low as 115 mmHg systolic BP (SBP) and 70 mmHg diastolic BP (DBP), and the risk increases steadily with elevating BP (Lewington et al. 2002). The most recent references for BP classification in adults are the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) in 2003. In this guideline, people with SBP of 120 to 139 mmHg and/or DBP of 80 to 89 mmHg are categorized as having prehypertension (Chobanian et al. 2003). Prehypertension and even normal BP frequently progress to clinical hypertension over several years, especially in older adults (Vasan et al. 2001). The incremental relationship between BP and CVD risk is continuous and consistent (Miura et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2002). Although prehypertension is associated with an increased risk of major CVD events (Chobanian et al. 2003), only limited data are available on the association between GGT and the prevalence of prehypertension among community-dwelling men in Japan.
Here, we evaluated the distribution of BP and GGT, as well as associated risk factors such as age, using cross-sectional data from community-dwelling men.

Seiyo-city, which has a total male population of 5,357 (as
of April 2002) and located in Ehime prefecture, Japan, in
2002. Among 4,395 male adults aged 19 to 90 years in

this population, 1,284 (29.2%) took part in the program and agreed to join the study. Information on medical history, present conditions, and drug usage was obtained by interview. Subjects with a clinical history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, or angina were excluded. The final study sample included 754 eligible men. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Ehime University School of Medicine and all participants gave written informed consent.
Evaluation of Risk Factors Information on demographic characteristics and risk
factors was collected using clinical files. Body mass index was calculated by dividing weight (in kilograms) by the square of the height (in meters). We measured BP with an appropriate-sized cuff on the right upper arm of participants in a sedentary position using an automatic oscillometric BP recorder (BP-103i; Colin, Aichi, Japan) while the subjects was seated after having rested for at least 5 min. Normotension was defined as SBP < 120 mmHg and DBP < 80 mmHg. Prehypertension was defined as SBP 120 to 139 mmHg and/or DBP 80 to 89 mmHg. Hypertension was defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg (Chobanian et al. 2003). Cigarette smoking was quantified based on daily consumption and duration of smoking. Fasting total cholesterol (T-C), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), creatinine (enzymatic method), uric acid and GGT were measured during fasting. Serum GGT concentration was assayed with an automatic analyzer (TBA-c16000, TOSHIBA, Tokyo) and this intraassay-coefficients of variation was 0.87 to 2.11% in GGT. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was calculated by the Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al. 1972). Participants with TG levels ≥ 400 mg/dL were excluded (24 cases). The presence of diabetes was defined as a history of treatment for diabetes. Estimated glomerular filtration ratio (eGFR) was calculated with the following equation: eGFR = 194 × Cr-1.094 × Age-0.287 (The Japanese Society of Nephrology: Japanese version of GFR estimation. http:// www.jsn.or.jp: Updated Oct 29, 2007.). Participants with an eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded (1 cases).
Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
10.0J (Statistical Package for Social Science, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All values are expressed as mean ±

standard deviation (S.D.), unless otherwise specified. The differences among groups categorized by serum GGT levels were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test or chisquare (χ 2) test. Correlations between various characteristics and GGT were determined using Spearman’s correlation. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of risk factors for SBP or DBP and logistic regression analyses were used to test significant determinants of prehypertension or hypertension status serving as the dichotomous outcome variable. To examine the consistency of the observed association between serum GGT levels and prehypertension, we performed subgroup analyses by age (< 60, ≥ 60 years), BMI (< 25, ≥ 25 kg/m2), drinking status (absent, present), TG (< 150, ≥ 150 mg/dL), HDL-C (≥ 40, < 40 mg/dL), and uric acid (< 7.0, ≥ 7.0 mg/dL). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
Subject background factors categorized by body mass index
The subjects consisted of 754 men, age 56 ± 15 (mean ± S.D.; range, 20-87) years. Table 1 shows subject characteristics categorized by serum GGT levels. Participants in higher GGT tertiles were younger, had higher BMI, and were more likely to have elevated DBP, TG, and uric acid. Smoking status, T-C, and FBG were significantly higher only in the middle tertile compared with the low tertile of serum GGT. Drinking status, SBP, HDL-C, and eGFR were significantly higher only in the high tertile compared with middle tertile of serum GGT. There were no intergroup differences in LDL-C and serum creatinine.

Association between various characteristics and BP status
Both SBP (r = 0.168, P < 0.001) and DBP (r = 0.295, P < 0.001) significantly increased progressively with increasing log GGT (Fig. 1). Multiple regression analysis using SBP and DBP as an objective variable, adjusted for risk factors as explanatory variables, showed that SBP independently associated with log GGT (β = 0.109) with age (β = 0.399), BMI (β = 0.251), drinking status (β = 0.079), HDL-C (β = 0.153), and FBG

(β = 0.116), and log GGT (β = 0.238) was also independently associated with DBP.
Association between GGT categories and risk for prehypertension or hypertension
Thirty-seven percent of participants had prehypertension and 39.3% had hypertension. Compared with the lowest tertile of serum GGT, the non-adjusted odds ratio for prehypertension was 1.84 (95% CI, 1.18-2.88) for the middle tertile and 3.05 (95% CI, 1.87-4.97) for the highest ter-

tile (Table 4). The age-adjusted odds ratio for prehypertension was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.24-3.07) for the middle tertile and 3.75 (95% CI, 2.25-6.26) for the highest tertile, with multivariate-adjusted odds ratios of 1.73 (95% CI, 1.06-2.81) for the middle tertile and 2.37 (95% CI, 1.31-4.31) for the highest tertile. Moreover, multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for hypertension were 1.82 (1.04-3.18) for the middle tertile and 3.11 (95% CI, 1.61-6.03) for the highest tertile.
Association between serum GGT levels and prehypertension
The OR of prehypertension associated with increasing levels of log-transformed serum GGT did not change within subgroups of age, BMI, drinking status, TG, HDL-C or uric acid (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this cross-sectional, population-based study, we determined the prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension, as defined by JNC-7 criteria (Chobanian et al. 2003), and their

relationship to GGT levels. In our study, participants were only 754 eligible men because of sex differences in GGT (Skurtveit and Tverdal 2002). This study showed that prehypertension is extremely common, affecting 37.1% of male subjects, and both SBP and DBP significantly increased with increasing GGT levels. Furthermore, higher GGT levels were significantly associated with risk for prehypertension or hypertension, even after adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, FBG, uric acid, and eGFR. Our data are in agreement with the results of previous prospective studies (Miura et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2003) showing that baseline serum GGT was an independent confounding factor for hypertension development, and we further suggest that serum GGT levels are also related to clinical prehypertension, a disease state when primary prevention is possible.
Our study found an overall prehypertension prevalence rate of 34.5% in rural adult male Japanese, similar to levels in Taiwanese adults (Tsai et al. 2005) and American adults (Greenlund

et al. 2004). We found that higher GGT levels were positively associated with prehypertension or hypertension, independent of other confounders. Similar results were found in a communitybased cross-sectional study in US adults (Shankar et al. 2007), with a multivariate-OR (95% CI) of 1.84 (1.37-2.46) comparing quartile 4 of GGT (> 29 U/L) to quartile 1 (< 13 U/L). This association persisted in separate analyses in men and women. Moreover, the results were consistent in subgroup analyses by race-ethnicity, age, smoking status, drinking status, BMI, waist circumference, and diabetes. Also in our study, the OR of GGT for prehypertension did not change within subgroups of age, BMI, drinking status, TG, HDL-C and uric acid. Furthermore, serum GGT levels correlated with relative changes in BP in individuals with normal GGT concentrations, a finding consistent with previous reports looking at hypertension (Miura et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2003).

Miura et al. (1994) suggest that the serum GGT levels may predict the future development of hypertension among drinkers after adjustment for baseline BP level and the amount of alcohol consumption, and Yamada et al. (1995) suggest that the association between serum GGT and hypertension appears to be quiet similar in both drinker and nondrinker.
Serum GGT is a marker of drinking alcohol and/or liver dysfunction such as fatty liver (Teschke et al. 1977). Although the association between serum GGT and prehypertension was only present in alcohol drinkers, it strongly persisted after adjusting for grams of alcohol drinking. This suggests that subjects with alcoholinduced serum GGT increases may have increased susceptibility to high BP (Lee et al. 2006). There were no significant differences in the incidence of prehypertension or serum GGT between drinkers and nondrinkers. Yamada et al. (1995) showed

that the association between serum GGT and BP status was present in both drinkers and nondrinkers, suggesting drinking status does not dramatically affect the usefulness of GGT as a biomarker for hypertension risk.
The mechanisms that lead to increased BP in individuals with increased GGT are not completely understood. Serum GGT is associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and abnormal glucose tolerance, suggesting that it is related to hepatic insulin resistance rather than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Ikai et al. 1994; Nilssen and Førde 1994; Kang et al. 2007). GGT plays a direct role in the generation of reactive oxygen species in the

presence of iron or other transition metals (Brown et al. 1998), inducing lipid peroxidation in human biological membranes (Paolicchi et al. 1997), and is an indirect marker of antioxidant systems, with the primary function of maintaining the intracellular concentration of glutathione in response to oxidative stress (Karp et al. 2001). Higher c-reactive protein or other inflammatory parameters, indicating sub-clinical inflammation, correlate with GGT levels, as do levels of nitrotyrosine, an oxidative stress maker (Bo et al. 2005). These findings suggest that GGT could be an early marker of oxidative stress and sub-clinical inflammation, perhaps related to the pathology of in-

creased BP as an oxidative stressor. Some limitations of this study must be con-
sidered. First, our cross-sectional study design does not eliminate potential causal relationships between GGT and increased BP. There still remain important problems on the cumulative effects of these CVD risk factors over several decades and the interactions with other risk factors. The prevalence of various BP categories is based on a single assessment of BP, which may introduce a misclassification bias. Moreover, a single measurement of GGT levels represents a limitation of the present study because 12% of adults with initially elevated GGT levels had normal levels at the second examination in the American general population (Lazo et al. 2008). Therefore the demographics and referral source may limit generalizability.
In conclusion, the present study showed that GGT levels correlate with prehypertension or hypertension in the general male population. The underlying mechanism seems to be independent from traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as age, BMI, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. For community-dwelling healthy persons, prospective population-based studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying this association to determine whether intervention, such as effective lifestyle modifications that decrease GGT in adult male populations, will decrease risks.

Aim: There is a strong relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study sought to clarify the association of fatty liver and an elevated serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) level with carotid atherosclerosis. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of subjects who underwent medical checkups at our institute. Carotid atherosclerosis and fatty liver were assessed using ultrasound (US), and predictors of increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque were identified using a logistic regression model. Results: In total, 958 subjects (564 men, 394 women; median age, 59 years) were enrolled. The median value of the mean carotid IMT was 0.713 mm, and the frequency of carotid plaque was 19.5%. For the highest quartile of the mean carotid IMT (≥ 0.863 mm), a male sex, older age, hypertension (HT), dyslipidemia (DL) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were identified as independent predictors. A male sex, older age, HT and elevated serum GGT level were found to be significant predictors of the presence of carotid plaque. In addition, fatty liver correlated with the existence of carotid plaque. When the combination of the serum GGT level and presence or absence of fatty liver was included as a variable in the analysis, a male sex, older age, HT and fatty liver with a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L (90th percentile) (odds ratio 3.21, 95% confidence interval 1.27–8.12, p = 0.014) were identified to be significantly associated with carotid plaque. Conclusions: This study suggests that the simultaneous presence of an elevated serum GGT level and fatty liver is highly predictive of carotid plaque.

Introduction
Atherosclerosis underlies the major pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death worldwide and responsible for approximately 30% of all deaths1, 2). Therefore, assessing atherosclerosis is essential for predicting and preventing

CVD in apparently healthy subjects. Due to its accessibility, simplicity and reproducibility, carotid ultrasound (US) is the most widely used tool for evaluating the degree of generalized atherosclerosis3), and there is a strong relationship between the detection of carotid atherosclerosis and future CVD events4-6).
Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple factors, such as aging, hypertension (HT), dyslipidemia (DL), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and smoking, are associated with carotid atherosclerosis7). Recently, other associated factors have been identified. The number of individuals with fatty liver has been increasing worldwide, and fatty liver has become the most common

liver disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 20% to 30% in the general population8). Furthermore, epidemiological studies have revealed a strong association between fatty liver and carotid atherosclerosis9, 10), and accumulating data indicate that elevated serum gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels are correlated with carotid atherosclerosis11, 12) and that GGT per se may play a direct role in the development of atherosclerosis13). In this context, studies have been conducted to determine whether an elevated serum GGT level and fatty liver are predictive of future CVD events. Some studies have examined the impact of elevated serum GGT levels on all-cause and CVD mortality and showed positive results14, 15), and similar results have been reported regarding the relationship between fatty liver and CVD events16). Notably, one study found that the serum GGT levels are significantly associated with all-cause and CVD mortality in men and that this association is stronger among those with increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma, known as the US sign of fatty liver17).
Aim
In the current study, we hypothesized that the simultaneous presence of fatty liver and an elevated serum GGT level may therefore be more strongly associated with atherosclerosis than the presence of either variable alone. Hence, we determined predictors of carotid atherosclerosis using a logistic regression model that included these two parameters.
Methods
Subjects We reviewed the medical records of subjects who
consecutively underwent medical checkups at our health evaluation center between 2011 and 2013. For subjects who underwent repeated medical checkups, we used their most recent records. The exclusion criteria included cases of insufficient recorded data, hepatitis B or C virus infection, a past and/or current history of cardiovascular or liver disease and past and/or current medications capable of influencing the course of atherosclerosis, such as anti-diabetic agents, antihypertensive agents, DL agents and antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kanazawa Medical University (approval no. 144) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Laboratory Tests The serum total cholesterol levels were measured

using the cholesterol oxidase method (Kyowa Medex Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The serum low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were measured according to the direct method (Sekisui Medical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), and the serum triglyceride levels were measured using an enzymatic color test (Kyowa Medex Co., Ltd). Additionally, the fasting blood glucose levels were assessed using the hexokinase method (ShinoTest Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and the serum alanine aminotransferase and GGT levels were measured using the Japan Society of Clinical Chemistry (JSCC) standardization method (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
Definitions of HT, DL, DM and Metabolic Syndrome
HT was defined according to the Japanese Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of HT, as follows: a systolic blood pressure of ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 90 mmHg18). DL was defined as a serum LDL cholesterol level of ≥ 140 mg/dL, serum HDL cholesterol level of ＜40 mg/dL or serum triglyceride level of ≥ 150 mg/dL, according to the criteria of the Japan Atherosclerosis Society19). DM was defined according to the guidelines of the Japan Diabetes Society, as follows: a fasting blood glucose level of ≥ 126 mg/dL and HbA1c level of ≥ 6.5%20). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Japanese criteria, as follows: a waist circumference of ≥ 85 cm for men and ≥ 90 cm for women and two or more of the following items, a serum triglyceride level of ≥ 150 mg/dL and/or serum HDL cholesterol level of ＜40 mg/dL, systolic blood pressure of ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 85 mmHg or a fasting blood glucose level of ≥ 110 mg/dL21).
Assessment of Carotid Atherosclerosis and Fatty Liver
Experienced ultrasonographers who were blinded to the medical checkup data of each subject performed the carotid and abdominal US examinations. Highresolution US machines (Aplio XG/500/80, Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, Tochigi, Japan) and a 5-MHz probe were used for abdominal US; the same US machines and an 8.4- or 9-MHz probe were used for carotid US. The mean carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was calculated by averaging six or eight measurements obtained from both sides of the far walls of the common carotid arteries. Carotid plaque

was defined as an IMT ＞1.5 mm in any portion of the carotid arteries22). The diagnosis of fatty liver was made based on the detection of increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma compared to that of the right renal cortex23). All US results were double checked by experienced ultrasonographers.
Statistical Analysis The variables are expressed as the median (10, 90
percentile). The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact probability test were used to compare categorical variables, and Student’s t -test, the Mann–Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare continuous variables. We further examined predictors of carotid atherosclerosis using a multiple logistic regression model; the objective variables included an increased mean carotid IMT (highest quartile) and the presence of carotid plaque, and the explanatory variables included sex (female/male), age (years), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), HT (absence/presence), DL (absence/presence), DM (absence/presence),

serum alanine aminotransferase level (IU/L), serum GGT level (IU/L), fatty liver (absence/presence), smoking status (nonsmoking and past smoking/current smoking) and alcohol consumption (≤ 20 g/day/ ＞20, ＜60 g/day/ ≥ 60 g/day). Following a univariate analysis of each variable, we performed a multivariate analysis using all variables. A p value of ＜0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version 11.1 software program (STATA Corp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
During the study period, 1,599 subjects underwent medical checkups at least once (813 subjects, once; 786 subjects, twice or more). Of these subjects, 56 were excluded due to insufficient data and 567 were excluded due to a past and/or current history of cardiovascular or liver disease and a past and/or current history of medications capable of influencing the

course of atherosclerosis. Of the remaining 976 subjects, eight were excluded due to hepatitis B virus infection and 10 were excluded due to hepatitis C virus infection. Therefore, 958 subjects (men 564, women 394; median age 59 years) were enrolled in this study. Table 1 lists the subject characteristics. The median value of the mean carotid IMT was 0.713 mm, and 19.5% (187/958) of the subjects had plaque. In total, 21.5% (206/958) of the subjects had fatty liver.
In order to determine the predictors of an increased mean carotid IMT, we used the highest quartile of the mean carotid IMT (≥ 0.863 mm) as the objective variable. In the univariate analysis, a male sex, older age, increased BMI, HT, DL, DM and fatty liver were identified as significant variables. In the multivariate analysis, a male sex, older age, HT, DL and DM were found to be independently associated with an increased mean carotid IMT (Table 2). Neither fatty liver (p = 0.133) nor an elevated serum GGT level (p = 0.542) were significant predictors. When the analysis was performed for each sex, there were differences with respect to the predictors of an increased mean carotid IMT. In men, an older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–1.16, p＜0.0001], HT (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.21–3.27, p =0.007), DL (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.07–2.75, p = 0.025) and DM (OR 6.09, 95% CI 1.93–19.26, p = 0.002) were significant predictors. Furthermore, fatty liver (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.31–3.91, p = 0.003) was significantly associated with an increased mean carotid IMT. In contrast, in women, an older age (OR

1.16, 95% CI 1.11–1.21, p＜0.0001) was the only significant predictor.
In the analysis of predictors of carotid plaque, a male sex, older age, HT, DL, elevated serum GGT level and increased alcohol consumption (＞20, ＜60 g/day) were found to be significant in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, a male sex, older age, HT and elevated serum GGT level were identified as independent predictors of the presence of carotid plaque (Table 3). Fatty liver (p = 0.093) and DL (p = 0.059) trended with the presence of carotid plaque. When the analysis was performed for each sex, there were differences with respect to the predictors of carotid plaque. For example, in men, an older age (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06–1.11, p＜0.0001), HT (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.21–3.14, p = 0.006) and elevated serum GGT level (OR 1.005, 95% CI 1.001–1.009, p = 0.025) were significant predictors, whereas in women, an older age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.07–1.17, p＜ 0.0001) was the only significant predictor.
To obtain the cut-off value of the serum GGT level for predicting carotid plaque, we calculated the odds ratios in the 50th, 75th and 90th percentiles. Consequently, the 90th percentile (83 IU/L) was chosen as the cut-off threshold (≥ 83 IU/L, OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.03–3.24, p = 0.038). When the enrolled subjects were divided into two groups according to the cut-off value of the serum GGT level, the rates of a male sex (89.7% vs. 55.4%), DL (63.9% vs. 44.3%), fatty liver (34.0% vs. 20.1%), current smokers (33.0% vs. 18.0%), alcohol consumption (＞20 g/day, 78.4% vs. 32.5%) and carotid plaque (32.0% vs. 18.1%)

were significantly higher among the subjects with a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L (n = 97) compared to those observed in the subjects with a serum GGT level of ＜83 IU/L (n =861). Furthermore, the BMI (median 23.7 kg/m2 vs. 22.7 kg/m2) and serum alanine aminotransferase level (median 31 IU/L vs. 19 IU/L) were also higher in the former group than in the latter group.
The subjects were divided into four groups based on the cut-off value of the serum GGT and the presence or absence of fatty liver (Table 4). The ratios of male to female subjects were higher in the groups with a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L, fatty liver and both compared to that seen in the group without these two factors. BMI and the rates of HT and DL were also higher in the subjects with fatty liver than in the subjects without fatty liver. The number of current smokers was highest in the group without fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L, followed by the groups with fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L, fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ＜83 IU/L and non-fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ＜83 IU/L. The number of subjects with moderate to severe alcohol consumption was highest in the group with non-fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L, followed by the groups with fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L, non-fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ＜83 IU/L and fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ＜83 IU/L. The mean carotid IMT was higher in the subjects with fatty liver than in those without fatty liver, and the ratio of patients with carotid plaque was highest in the group with fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L, followed by the groups with non-fatty liver and a serum GGT level of

≥ 83 IU/L, fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ＜83 IU/L and non-fatty liver and a serum GGT level of ＜83 IU/L.
Table 5 shows the predictors of carotid plaque when the combination of the serum GGT level and the presence or absence of fatty liver was included as an explanatory variable. In the univariate analysis, a male sex, older age, HT, DL, the combination of fatty liver and serum GGT ≥ 83 IU/L and increased alcohol consumption (＞20, ＜60 g/day) were identified as significant variables. In the multivariate analysis, a male sex, older age, HT, fatty liver and serum GGT level of ≥ 83 IU/L (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.27–8.12, p = 0.014) were independent predictors of carotid plaque.
Discussion
The current findings suggest that an elevated serum GGT level and fatty liver are closely associated with carotid atherosclerosis, although this association was stronger for carotid plaque than for an increased mean carotid IMT. Moreover, when the serum GGT levels and fatty liver were combined in the analysis of predictors of carotid plaque, the simultaneous presence of an elevated serum GGT level and fatty liver was significant. In contrast, an elevated serum GGT level without fatty liver and fatty liver without an elevated serum GGT level were not significant.
In the current study, we used fatty liver and the serum GGT level as two distinct variables. Although fatty liver and the serum GGT level are positively correlated with each other24), the relationship between these two parameters is not necessarily constant. Alco-

hol consumption25), smoking26), an older age27) and obesity28) can increase the serum GGT levels and thereby modify the relationship between fatty liver and the serum GGT level. Therefore, our analyses were conducted to clarify the manner in which fatty liver and an elevated serum GGT level are associated with carotid atherosclerosis in the same logistic regression model.
We compared our results with those of previous studies investigating the association of fatty liver and an elevated serum GGT level with carotid atherosclerosis. In a systematic review analyzing the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and carotid atherosclerosis, liver disease was positively correlated with both an increased carotid IMT and carotid plaque9). In contrast, a recent study of a Japanese pop-

ulation demonstrated a positive correlation between the serum GGT levels and increased carotid IMT values (although the analyses were univariate)12). Another large-scale study by Kozakova et al., in which the subjects were free of CVD, HT, DL, DM and metabolic syndrome, examined the association between the fatty liver index (FLI) (an index used to predict the presence of fatty liver) and carotid atherosclerosis. These authors reported the following conclusions: 1) FLI is a significant predictor of an increased mean carotid IMT, but not an elevated serum GGT level, when FLI is replaced by parameters used in its equation (BMI, waist circumference, serum triglyceride level and serum GGT level) and 2) FLI is a significant predictor of carotid plaque, with an elevated serum GGT level also being identified as a significant predictor when

FLI is replaced by other parameters11). The results of our study and the study by Kozakova et al. are similar in terms of the close association between an elevated serum GGT level and carotid plaque. Our results also suggest that the presence of fatty liver reinforces this association. Conversely, an elevated serum GGT level enhances the association between fatty liver and carotid plaque. In our cohort, traditional factors, including an older age, HT, DL and DM, were more strongly associated with an increased mean carotid IMT than fatty liver.
In the current study, the results revealed sex differences with respect to the predictors of carotid atherosclerosis. For example, in men, fatty liver and an elevated serum GGT level were identified to be predictors of an increased mean carotid IMT and carotid plaque, whereas in women, neither of these two parameters were significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis. These findings are in agreement with those of previous studies in which the association of an elevated serum GGT level with oxidative stress12) and that of an elevated serum GGT level and fatty liver with CVD mortality17) were found to be stronger in men than in women. Future studies are needed to clarify the reasons underlying these sex differences.
Accumulating data suggest that GGT per se may play a role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of GGTpositive foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques29, 30). In addition, another study by Franzini et al. examined human carotid plaques and revealed the presence of

glutathione, cysteinyl-glycine, cysteine and LDL/GGT complexes31). Cysteinyl-glycine, a dipeptide derived from GGT-mediated glutathione degradation, promotes LDL oxidation via an iron reduction reaction that results in the production of superoxide radicals. This GGT-induced LDL oxidation may be a possible underlying mechanism of atherosclerotic progression13). The study by Franzini et al. also demonstrated a positive correlation between the serum GGT level and GGT activity in atherosclerotic plaques31). Our results showing an elevated serum GGT level to be associated with carotid plaque are in agreement with the above findings, and this association supports the concept of the presumptive pathological mechanism of atherosclerosis.
The role of fatty liver in atherosclerosis, particularly the causal relationship between fatty liver and atherosclerosis, remains to be fully elucidated. Some researchers believe fatty liver is a cause of atherosclerosis, whereas some researchers believe that fatty liver is only a bystander to atherosclerosis. Various evidence supports the first hypothesis, as the putative underlying mechanisms of atherosclerosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease include insulin resistance, atherogenic DL, chronic inflammation (as represented by elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α), hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis (as represented by elevated serum levels of fibrinogen, factor VII and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1)32). In particular, one study examined the associations between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
