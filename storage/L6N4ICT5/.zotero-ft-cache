Optimized Determination of ‘y-Glutamyltransferase by Reaction-Rate Analysis
Sidney B. Rosalki and David Tarlow

We describe a method for measuring -y-glutamyltrans-
ferase (EC 2.3.2.2) activity in serum, which can be used with automated enzyme analyzers (such as the LKB 8600 Reaction Rate Analyzer) that require enzyme reactions to be initiated with substrate. The method also permits optimal determination conditions to be obtained at 37 #{176T}hCe. enzymatic reaction is commenced by adding y-glutamyl-p.nitroanilide dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid to samples pre-incubated with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-glycylglycine buffer. The p-nitroaniline liberated is continously monitored at 37 #{176a}tC 405 nm. The pH of the pre-incubation buffer is such that the optimal pH for the enzyme reaction results from addition of the acid substrate solution.

even more pronounced at 37 #{176f}oCr , at this tempera-

ture the substrate Michaelis constant (Km) is almost

double that at 25 #{17(64},5C), and its optimal concentra-

tion significantly greater.

We describe here a method for y-glutamyltransfer-

ase determination

by reaction-rate

(kinetic) analysis

in which the enzymatic reaction is started by adding

a concentrated substrate solution and that permits

optimal reaction conditions to be obtained at 37 #{176}C.
The enzymatic reaction is started by adding “y-glu-

tamyl-p-nitroanilide,

dissolved in dilute hydrochloric

acid, to samples pre-incubated

with tris(hydroxy-

methyl)aminomethane-glycylglycine

buffer at 37 #{176}C.

The pH of the pre-incubation

buffer is such that the

pH for the enzymatic reaction is optimal when the

acid substrate solution is added.

The enzyme y-glutamyltransferase

(EC 2.3.2.2)

catalyzes the transfer of the -y-glutamyl group from

y-glutamyl-peptides

to suitable acceptors, and is

widely determined in clinical laboratories in the in-

vestigation of liver disease. In modern determination

procedures y-L-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide

is almost in-

variably used as substrate for the transferase and gly-

cylglycine as the glutamyl group acceptor. The en-

zyme liberates p-nitroaniline

from the substrate, and

this compound has a pronounced yellow color, where-

as the substrate is practically colorless. The rate of

increase in absorbance at a suitable wavelength (such

as 405 nm) thus provides a measure of enzyme activi-

ty.

Because -y-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide

is poorly solu-

ble in many buffers and solvents, the enzymatic reac-

tion cannot readily be begun by adding concentrated

substrate to sample. This has caused difficulty in at-

tempts to adapt the enzyme reaction to automated or

semi-automated

enzyme analyzers (such as the LKB

8600 Reaction Rate Analyzer) in which enzyme reac-

tions must be started by a small volume of concen-

trated substrate solution (1-3). Such difficulties are

Materials and Methods

Reagents

Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane

(115 mmol/

liter)-glycylglycine

(138 mmol/liter)buffer.

Dissolve

6.96 g of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane

(British

Drug Houses Ltd., Poole, England), and 9.11 g of gly-

cylglycine (British Drug Houses Ltd.) in about 400

ml of distilled water. Adjust the pH to 8.5 at 37 #{176}C

with sodium hydroxide solution (0.5 mmolfliter), and

dilute to 500 ml with water. This buffer is stable for

at least three months at 4 #{176}C.

-y-Glutamyl-p-nitroanilide

substrate (104 mmol/

liter). Dissolve 29.5 mg of 7-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide

monohydrate

(DADE Division American Hospital

Supply Corp., Miami, Fla. 33152; Sigma, London; or

Boehringer Mannheim Corp.) per milliliter of dilute

hydrochloric acid (0.5 mol/liter). (Prepare a suffi-

cient amount for the day’s determinations;

0.1 ml is

required per test. Use as soon as possible, preferably

within 2 h.)

Procedure
Pre-warm 50 l of sample and 1.0 ml of buffer to 37 #{176}C.
Start the reaction by adding 0.1 ml of substrate, and continuously monitor the rate of absorbance increase at 405 nm at 37 #{176}C.

CLINICALCHEMISTRY,Vol. 20, No. 9, 1974 1121

Apparatus
Initial reaction rates at 37 #{176w}eCre continuously monitored in cells of 10-mm lightpath, with the LKB 8600 Reaction Rate Analyser (LKB Instruments Ltd., Surrey, England) equipped with a 405-nm interference filter. Instrument background absorbance compensation was set to an absorbance value of 0.7, and absorbance increases were monitored for 1 mm.

Calculation

One International

Unit (U) of 7-glutamyltransfer-

ase is that enzyme activity that will liberate 1 tmol of

p-nitroaniline

per minute under the test conditions.

The absorbance at 405 nm of a 1 mol/liter solution of

p-nitroaniline

is 9900 in cells of 10-mm lightpath, so

that a solution containing 1 mol of p-nitroaniline

in

1.0 ml would have an absorbance of 9.9, and the for-

mation of 1 zmol of p-nitroaniline

in the 1.15 ml final

test volume would produce an absorbance increase

(zIA) of 9.9/1.15 = 8.609. The number of micromoles

of p-nitroaniline

formed per minute in the test cuvet

is therefore equal to the observed A/min divided by

8.609. Under the conditions of assay, this many mi-

cromoles of p-nitroaniline

are liberated by 0.05 ml of

serum or other enzyme-containing

sample. The

equivalent number of micromoles of p-nitroaniline

liberated per minute from 1 liter of sample is there-

fore equal to observed A/min X (20 000/8.609).

Sample y-glutamyltransferase

activity in Interna-

tional Units (U) per liter at the chosen temperature

is therefore equal to observed XA/min X 2323.

Notes on the Method

1. A substrate blank, in which water is substituted

for sample, should be included in each daily run, to

correct for spontaneous decomposition of substrate;

any increase in blank absorbance being subtracted

from that observed with the test samples. In practice,

substrate blank activity did not exceed the equiva-

lent of 3 U/liter at 37 #{176N}Cev. ertheless, slight sub-

strate decomposition on standing increases the initial

substrate absorbance, so that substrate should be

used within 2 h of preparation.

2. Absorbance increases should be linear and were

invariably so in practice. Sera with activities >2000

U/liter at 37 #{17s6h}oCuld be appropriately diluted with

distilled water and re-determined,

because their rate

of absorbance increase is inconveniently

high. The

method was shown to be linear without dilution up to

2000 U/liter at 37 #{176}C.

3. The pH upon addition of 0.1 ml of substrate to

1.0 ml of buffer should be 8.0 at 37 #{176I}f Ci.t is not, ad-

just the pH of the buffer with 0.5 mol/liter sodium

hydroxide or hydrochloric acid as appropriate. Sever-

al sera were pre-incubated

with pH 8.5 to pH 9.0

buffers for 2 h, and their activities compared with

these obtained with 5-mm pre-warming. Near-identi-

cai activities were obtained, confirming the pre-incu-

bation step to be noninhibitory.

1122 CLINICAL CHEMISTRY, Vol. 20, No. 9, 1974

4. The final reaction conditions are: substrate, 9.0

mmol/liter; tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,

100

mmol/liter; glycylglycine, 120 mmol/liter; pH 8.0 at

37 #{176}C.

Results

The procedure was compared with the manual

end-point method of Rosalki et al. (4) (which is also

done at 37 #{176}caCr)ried out at its optimal pH of 8.3.

The two methods were run within 24 h of each other,

on sera stored at 4 #{17m6}eCanwhile. Comparisons were

made on sera from patients with liver disease. Forty-

two sera were examined, and gave a correlation coef-

ficient (r) of 0.982 with a regression equation of y =

1.29x - 9.44 (where y = activity with the optimized

reaction-rate method, x = activity with the end-point

method) (Figure 1). Precision studies with the reac-

tion-rate procedure gave a within-day precision

(coefficient of variation, CV) of 2.5% (n = 20) at a

mean activity of 35 U/liter at 37 #{176a}nCd, 1.4% (n =

20) at a mean activity of 273 U/liter at 37 #{17o6n}Crepli-

cate analyses of single sera. Between-day precision

(CV) was 6.0% (n = 51) at a mean activity of 83 U/

liter at 37 #{17a6n}dC 3.5% (n = 30) at a mean activity of

120 U/liter at 37 #{176}BCe.tween-day

precision was

studied during five days, the sera being re-examined

24 h after their initial determination

and stored at 4

#{17m6}eCanwhile.

Fresh sera from 193 apparently healthy volunteer

blood donors (120 men, 73 women) were examined.

The distribution of enzyme values in both sexes was

unimodel but skewed to the right. Enzyme values for

each sex were therefore plotted as a cumulative fre-

quency distribution on logarithmic probability paper

(6). This gave linear plots, extrapolation of which in-

dicated an upper limit of normal (98% probability) of

50 U/liter at 37 #{17f6o}rCmen and 30 U/liter at 37 #{17f6o}rC

women.

Derivation of Optimal Reaction Conditions

Optimal conditions for the enzyme reaction at 37

#{17w6}eCre established by variation of pH, substrate, ac-

ceptor, and buffer concentration, by using sera from

patients with alcoholic liver disease.

Initially, substrate concentration

was varied at a

constant buffer concentration of 100 mmol/liter, con-

stant acceptor concentration

of 120 mmol/liter [a

value 10 times the acceptor Km value previously ob-

served by the end-point method (4)], a buffer pH of

8.5 at 37 #{176a}nCd, substrate dissolved in 0.5 mol/liter
hydrochloric acid such that the final pH was 8.0 at 37

#{176F}Cin.al substrate concentrations

up to 20 mmol/

liter were obtainable for short periods without sub-

strate precipitation.

The optimal substrate concen-

tration was found to be between 8 and 10 mmolfliter,

and above this value inhibition was observed (Figure

2). Lineweaver-Burk

plots (7) showed an average Km

value for -y-glutamyl p-nitroanilide

of 1.9 mmol/liter

(Figure 3)-a value identical with that previously ob-

served with the end-point method (4).

At a 9 mmol/liter substrate concentration, varying

the glycyiglycine acceptor concentration

up to 200

mmol/liter indicated an optimal glycylglycine con-

centration to be approached at about 50 mmol/liter,

but no inhibition was found at higher values (Figure

12.0 mmol/liter (Figure 5), a value also nearly identical with that previously observed with the end-point
method (4). An acceptor concentration of 120 mmol/
liter, i.e., some 10-fold the Km value, was therefore adopted. Wide variation in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane concentration (25 to 200 mmol/liter) was without effect, and for this reason 100 mmol/liter was chosen as a convenient final concentration. Under these conditions of substrate, acceptor, and buffer
concentration, a final pH of 8.0 at 37 #{17w6}aCs optimal
(Figure 6).

Discussion

Previous attempts to automate -y-glutamyltrans-

ferase determination

by using discrete enzyme ana-

lyzers and reaction-rate analysis have not been en-

tirely satisfactory. Thus, with the Unicam AC 1800

apparatus at 30 #{176}MCo,ss and Whitfield (1) were

from sample to sample by the time the reaction is initiated with glycylglycine. A solution to this difficulty has been proposed by Seiffart and Chaves (3) for use at 25 #{176T}hCey. pre-incubate sample and substrate at pH 6.0, returning the pH to optimal (8.2) with initiation of the reaction by glycylglycine addition. At pH 6.0 they saw no substrate hydrolysis by sample during pre-incubation and no spontaneous substrate breakdown or sample inactivation.
A more satisfactory procedure for ‘y-glutamyltransferase determination and automation is proposed here, utilizing the solubility of 7-glutamyl p-nitroanilide in hydrochloric acid (9). The procedure is simple and can be highly precise. It allows reaction initiation with substrate, and enables a far higher substrate concentration to be achieved than in any of the preceding methods, permitting the use of optimal substrate concentration and reaction conditions at 37 #{176A}sC.a result of this optimization, it yields values some 20% higher than the manual end-point method with which it was compared.

forced to modify the instrument to permit initiation

with sample rather than substrate. Yap et al. (2),

using the Gilford 2000 system, were able to initiate

the kinetic reaction with substrate; they used a con-

centrated substrate solution dissolved in diethylene

glycol. However, this solvent caused absorbance de-

creases with hemoglobin and hemolyzed samples,

making it necessary to add solvent to the sample dil-

uent. In addition, it produced approximately

10% in-

hibition of enzyme activity. Using the LKB 8600, De-

larue (8) described a procedure (run at 35 #{176}iCn ),

which the reaction was initiated with substrate dis-

solved in buffer, but at such a low final concentration

(1.03 mmol of y-glutamyl p-nitroanilide and 10.3

mmol of glycylglycine per liter) that the method can-

not be recommended. Indeed, both substrate and ac-

ceptor concentrations are below their Km values, so

that enzyme activities cannot represent even 50% of

their theoretical maximal velocity. Another undesir-

able practice is that adopted by some commercial re-

agent manufacturers, of initiating the enzyme reac-

tion with the acceptor glycyiglycine after pre-incuba-

tion of enzyme with substrate. Substrate hydrolysis

and transpeptidation to substrate (“internal” trans-

peptidation) may take place during such pre-incuba-

tion, resulting in substrate concentration variation
