A significant association between elevations of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (y-GTP) levels and those of blood pressure and hypertension has been reported separately in drinkers and nondrinkers. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether the relationship between serum y-GTP and the prevalence of hypertension is the same or similar in both drinkers and nondrinkers. The study subjects com-
prised 4,920 male nondrinkers, 9,390 male daily drinkers, 8,081 female nondrinkers, and 278 female daily drinkers, who were aged 40 to 59 years. The prevalence of hypertension in the male and female daily drinkers was 1.5 and 1.3 times, respectively, higher than in the nondrinkers. Mean systolic blood pressure in the male and female drinkers was 4.4 and 3.1 mmHg, respectively, higher than in the nondrinkers. After adjusting for age, body mass index, and serum y-GTP levels, the differences in the prevalence of hypertension and the mean systolic blood pressure level between the drinkers and nondrinkers decreased to 1.2 times and 2.7 mmHg, respectively. Although these small differences remained statistically significant, the association between serum y-GTP and hypertension appears to be quite similar in both drinkers and nondrinkers, suggesting that hepatic steatosis may play a common, pathogenetic role in the development of hypertension.

A large number of epidemiological studies have confirmed an association between the volume of
alcohol consumed and blood pressure levels (1, 2). The reliability of the reported alcohol consumption
data in epidemiological studies has been questioned, but a close association between the level of serum
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (y-GTP), which is a well-known biological indicator of alcohol consumption, and blood pressure has also been
observed by many researchers (3-7). The mechanism underlying the elevation of y -
GTP in the sera of alcohol consumers has been debated, but hepatic cell-membrane damage (8-10),
rather than enzyme-induction (10, 11), has been suggested to be the major mechanism. The association of serum y-GTP with blood pressure elevations in alcohol consumers was also suggested to be a
reflection of hepatic cell damage rather than enzyme induction, since serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is elevated in alcoholic liver
disease but not induced in the liver cells (12, 13), also showed an association with blood pressure in
alcohol consumers (14). The hepatic cell damage must be related to hepatic steatosis since it is the
earliest liver manifestation in alcohol consumers
(15, 16).

On the other hand, a significant association of serum y-GTP with blood pressure and hypertension has been found even in nondrinkers (17-19). In
people without a drinking habit, elevations of serum
y-GTP, as well as those of other serum hepatic enzymes such as asparate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are thought to
reflect the progression of hepatic steatosis with increasing body weight (20, 21). Hepatic steatosis may play an important role in the development of
insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, resulting in hypertension (22, 23).
These previous findings suggest that elevations of serum y -GTP levels, which could be a reflection of hepatic steatosis, may relate to blood pressure
elevations and hypertension in both alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers. However, drinkers and nondrinkers have been evaluated for the relationship sepa-
rately, and the similarity of the relationship has not been fully evaluated. In the present study, we com-
pared the relationship between serum y-GTP levels and blood pressure and hypertension in middle-aged men and women who consumed alcohol or did not
to determine if that the relationship is similar in alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers.

Methods
Male and female subjects, who were between 40 to 59 years of age and either consumed alcohol or did not, were recruited from among all participants in this age group, (21,873 men and 10,449 women) who underwent a health screening program conducted by an occupational health service facility during the one-year period of 1992. The participants who stated in a self-report questionnaire that they had not drunk at all, or had drunk only a small volume ( < 10 ml) of alcohol not more often than once a month during the preceding one-year period, were regarded as essentially nondrinkers.
On the other hand, the participants who had drunk alcoholic beverages almost every day were defined as daily drinkers. The male nondrinkers and daily drinkers numbered 4,920 and 9,390, respectively, and the female nondrinkers and daily drinkers 8,081 and 278, respectively. The remaining 9,653 male and female participants who had drunk alcoholic beverages sometimes but not every day, and thus had consumed a smaller volume than the daily drinkers, were excluded from the present study to facilitate comparison between the nondrinkers and daily drinkers.
In the health screening program, body weight was measured with only the jacket removed, and the value of body weight was determined as the measured weight minus 1 kg. Blood pressure was measured once using an automatic oscillometric monitor, BP-103N (Nippon Colin, Japan), following the recommendations of the Japanese Association for Cerebro-cardiovascular Disease Control for the mass screening of hypertension using automatic equipment (24, 25). Namely, blood pressure was measured after the subjects had rested on a chair for five minutes or longer, using cuffs 13 cm wide and 24 cm long. After the measurement of blood
pressure, fasting venous blood was obtained from the cubital vein, and serum y -GTP level was determined using an automatic analyzer, Hitachi 7250
(Hitachi, Japan). The subjects were divided into four categories of

body mass index (BMI: kg/m2): slender (BMI <20 kg/m2), medium (20-24 kg/m2), overweight (25-27 kg/m2), and obese (BMI> 28 kg/m2). The subjects were then divided into five categories of serum y GTP levels: less than 15, 15 to 29, 30 to 59, 60 to 119, and above 120 U/l. This categorization of serum y-GTP level was based on the fact that the
geometric mean value of serum y-GTP in the male participants aged 40 to 59 years in the health checkups was around 30 U/l, and the geometric standard deviation was 2.0.
The prevalence of hypertension was calculated in each of the categories, and compared among the different categories of serum y -GTP levels for each category of BMI in both drinkers and nondrinkers, and in both men and women. Hypertension was defined here as being present in persons who showed blood pressure levels above 160/95 mmHg at the health check-ups or those being treated with hy-
potensive agents. After excluding the subjects receiving hypotensive agents, the means of blood
pressure were then compared among the categories. The differences in the relationships of serum y -
GTP to the prevalence of hypertension or to blood
pressure levels between drinkers and nondrinkers, and between men and women, after adjusting for age and BMI, were statistically evaluated by a multiple logistic regression analysis and a generalized linear model analysis. These statistical analyses were performed using an SAS program package distributed by SAS Japan for a personal computer, PC-98 RL (NEC, Japan) . Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
Results
Means and standard deviations of age, BMI, serum
y-GTP, and blood pressure in the male and female subjects with or without alcohol consumption are shown in Table 1. Geometric means and geometric standard deviations were obtained for serum yGTP levels. The means of all these variables were significantly higher in the men than in the women. Mean age and BMI were 1.3 year and 0.3 kg/m2 respectively higher in the men than in the women.

Men and Women with or without Alcohol Consumption

According to Body Mass Size

The geometric mean of serum y -GTP was 1.5 times
higher in the men than in the women. Differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the
men and women were 5.9 and 4.8 mmHg, respectively.
On the other hand, there were no significant differences in age and BMI between the drinkers and nondrinkers, either in the men or women. How-
ever, geometric means of serum y-GTP in the men and women with alcohol consumption were 1.7 and 1.5 times, respectively, higher than in those without
alcohol consumption. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in the male drinkers were 4.4 and 3.4 mmHg, respectively, higher than those in
the male nondrinkers. Respective differences between the female drinkers and nondrinkers were 3.1 and 2.1 mmHg.
Although not shown in the table, the prevalence of hypertension in the combined total of male and
female subjects was 16.6 and 10.6%, respectively,
i.e. 1.6 times more prevalent in men as compared to women. Hypertension was found in 626 of 4,920 male nondrinkers (12.7%) but in 1,748 of 9,390
male drinkers (18.6%), and in 844 of 8,081 female nondrinkers (10.4%) and 38 of 278 female drinkers
(13.7%). Thus, hypertension in men and women with alcohol consumption was 1.5 and 1.3 times, respectively, more frequent than in those without it.
The numbers of male and female subjects with or
without alcohol consumption in each category of BMI and serum y -GTP are shown in Table 2. In
women, the numbers of subjects with higher serum

each of the categories are summarized in Table 3, excluding the categories with numbers less than ten
in women. The prevalences of hypertension were increased with increased BMI, but were higher at
higher serum y-GTP levels at all levels of body

mass size, in both drinkers and nondrinkers, and in both men and women.
The mean of blood pressure was then calculated
in each of the categories, after excluding the sub-
jects being treated with hypotensive agents. Table 4 shows the mean systolic blood pressure levels in the male and female subjects with or without alcohol consumption according to body mass size and serum
y-GTP levels. The mean values were elevated with increased BMI, but were also higher at higher
serum y-GTP levels. Similar results were obtained for diastolic blood pressure, although not shown in the table.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of hypertension with the variables of age, BMI, and serum y-GTP
levels, separately in the male and female drinkers and nondrinkers. All three variables were signi-
ficantly related to the prevalence of hypertension in both sexes and in both drinkers and nondrinkers.
The results of the analysis including sex and the difference in alcohol consumption as independent vari-
ables are shown in Table 5. Among daily drinkers the odds ratio of hypertension was 1.24 as com-
pared with nondrinkers; and among female daily d rinkers the odds ratio of hypertension was 1.24 as compared with male daily drinkers, which meant
that the prevalence of hypertension among male
daily drinkers was 0.81 times that among female daily drinkers.
Generalized linear model analysis of systolic blood pressure and related variables in the male and female drinkers and nondrinkers also showed
that age, BMI, and serum y -GTP levels, were all significantly related to blood pressure in both sexes
and in both drinkers and nondrinkers. Table 6 shows the results of the analysis including sex and
the difference in alcohol consumption as independent variable. The daily drinkers showed a systolic

blood pressure 2.7 mmHg higher than the nondrink-
ers, and this difference was statistically significant. On the other hand, systolic blood pressure was shown to be 0.4 mmHg higher in the men than in
the women, but this difference not statistically significant.
The results of multiple logistic regression analysis
indicated that an increased prevalence of hypertension was associated with increased BMI in both
male and female subjects with or without alcohol consumption, for the three levels of serum y-GTP
of 20, 50 and 100 U/l (Fig. 1; age fixed at 50 years).
