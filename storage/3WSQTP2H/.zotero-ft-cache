Objective Serum g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease, and there is a strong association between serum GGT levels and most CV risk factors, including hypertension; however, the role of serum GGT level as an independent risk factor for target organ damage in hypertension remains controversial. Accordingly, we aimed to determine whether serum GGT level is independently and speciﬁcally associated with coronary ﬂow reserve (CFR) impairment in hypertensive patients.

Conclusion These results support a role for serum GGT level as an independent marker of target organ damage in hypertensive subjects without concomitant risk factors. J Hypertens 25:2497–2503 Q 2007 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Introduction Recent epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) is an independent risk factor for the mortality and morbidity of cardiovascular (CV) disease [1,2]. There is a strong association between serum GGT levels and many CV risk factors, including hypertension [3–5]. In addition, several prospective studies reported that baseline serum GGT concentration was an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus, stroke and hypertension [5–9].
Patients with hypertension may have symptoms and signs of myocardial ischemia despite angiographically normal coronary arteries, which may be related to impaired coronary microvascular function [10]. In the absence of epicardial coronary artery stenosis, coronary ﬂow reserve (CFR) may be considered a marker of coronary microvascular function, and attenuated CFR is mostly the result of minimal changes in coronary resistance that

are independent of vascular tone [11–13]. Therefore, structural changes in the coronary vasculature are most likely to be the major contributors to altered CFR. Quantitative histological studies performed on septal biopsy tissue showed that reduced coronary dilatory capacity was associated with increased arteriolar media area, and perivascular and interstitial ﬁbrosis in patients with arterial hypertension and angina pectoris in the absence of relevant coronary artery stenosis [12]. These conditions are sensitive indicators of hypertensive targetorgan damage [12,13]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that impairment of CFR may occur very early in hypertension before hypertrophy is apparent, and may cause subsequent ischemia and ﬁbrosis [11]. Thus, the search for impaired CFR may be recommended as part of global risk assessment. Accordingly, the present study was performed to evaluate the association between serum GGT concentrations and impaired CFR in a group of middle-aged never-treated and newly diagnosed patients with essential hypertension without concomitant risk factors.

Methods
Study population The overall study population included 100 never-treated and newly diagnosed essential hypertensive subjects. In each subject, blood pressure was measured on three separate days in a week, after 15 min of sitting comfortably, and these three values were averaged. Individuals who had diastolic blood pressure (BP) ! 90 mmHg and/or systolic BP ! 140 mmHg in the ofﬁce setting were diagnosed as hypertensive. A complete physical examination was performed, with particular attention to peripheral arterial pulses and carotid bruits. Each subject was questioned about major CV risk factors, including family history of CAD, current smoking status, alcohol consumption and diabetes mellitus. Family history of CAD was obtained by questioning the subjects about CAD in ﬁrst-degree male relatives before 55 years and in female relatives before 65 years of age. Age, gender and body mass index (BMI) were recorded. Fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which were measured with original kits using an Abbott-Aeroset autoanalyzer (Chicago, Illinois, USA), were noted. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein were measured by use of a highly sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Abbott-Aeroset autoanalyzer. Serum GGT levels were measured at 378C by enzymatic calorimetric test using a Roche/Hitachi analyzer (Mannheim, Germany) [2]. The normal reference value of the GGT level for a healthy individual was 8–61 U/l in our laboratory. The hypertensive subjects were divided into two groups based on median value of serum GGT levels (21 U/l for women, 30 U/l for men): 49 subjects with lower GGT (group I) and 48 subjects with higher GGT level (group II). Tests for interaction between GGT and gender were signiﬁcant; therefore, all analyses were conducted with stratifying for gender.
Inclusion criteria included 18–55 years of age, and a regular menstrual cycle for women. Exclusion criteria included the presence of any systemic disease such as hemolytic, hepatic, and renal diseases or any disease that could impair CFR [e.g. diabetes mellitus: fasting plasma glucose level measured on three separate days in a week > 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l); or impaired oral glucose tolerance test: fasting plasma glucose < 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) but 2-h plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose challenge > 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l)], family history of CAD and excessive alcohol consumption (> 50 g/day). Subjects were excluded from the study if they used any vasoactive drug, had undergone previous antihypertensive therapy, were current smokers and had ST-segment or T-wave changes speciﬁc for myocardial ischemia (including strain pattern), Q waves and incidental left bundle branch block on ECG. Individuals were also excluded if they had severe dyslipidemia and/or excessive obesity (HDL

cholesterol levels < 30 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol levels > 160 mg/dl, triglyceride levels > 400 mg/dl, BMI greater than 35 kg/m2), elevated other liver enzymes, or left ventricular mass index (LVMI) > 126 g/m (> 48 g/m2.7) in men and > 99 g/m (> 44 g/m2.7) in women [14] (to avoid the confounding effects of LVH on CFR). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. The institutional ethics committee approved the study protocol.
Echocardiographic examination Each subject was examined using an Acuson Sequoia C256 Echocardiography System equipped with 3V2c and 5V2c broadband transducers with second harmonic capability (Acuson Corp., Mountain View, California, USA). Two-dimensional, M-mode and subsequent transthoracic Doppler echocardiographic examinations were performed on each subject.
Left ventricular mass determination Left ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated from M-mode records taken on parasternal long-axis images according to the formula below (corrected American Society of Echocardiography cube method) [14,15].

where IVSd is the interventricular septum thickness at diastole; PWd, the posterior wall thickness at diastole; and LVDD, the left ventricular diastolic diameter. To take into account differences in body size that might inﬂuence cardiac size, left ventricular mass was divided by height and height2.7 to create an LVMI.
Coronary ﬂow reserve measurement The visualization of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was performed using a modiﬁed, foreshortened, two-chamber view obtained by sliding the transducer on the upper part and medially from an apical two-chamber view, to reach the best alignment to the interventricular sulcus. Coronary ﬂow in the distal LAD was examined by color Doppler ﬂow mapping over the epicardial part of the anterior wall, with the color Doppler velocity set in the range of 8.9–24.0 cm/s [16]. The left ventricle was imaged on the long-axis cross-section, and the ultrasound beam was then inclined laterally. Next, coronary blood ﬂow in the LAD (middle to distal) was searched by color Doppler ﬂow mapping (Fig. 1). All subjects had Doppler recordings of the LAD with dipyridamole infusion at a rate of 0.56 mg/kg over 4 min. By placing the sample volume on the color signal, spectral Doppler of the LAD showed the characteristic biphasic ﬂow pattern with larger diastolic and smaller systolic components (Fig. 1). Coronary diastolic peak velocities were measured at baseline and after dipyridamole by

averaging the highest three Doppler signals for each measurement. CFR was deﬁned as the ratio of hyperemic to baseline diastolic peak velocities [16]. CFR ! 2.0 was considered normal [16–18]. CFR measurement was achieved in 97 of 100 subjects (97%). To test the coefﬁcient of repeatability of the CFR measurement, the measurement was repeated in 10 subjects 2 days later. Intra-observer intra-class correlation coefﬁcients for coronary ﬂow measurements were 0.902 and 0.852 (baseline and hyperemic diastolic peak velocities, respectively), and for CFR value it was 0.886.
Statistical analyses All analyses were conducted using SPSS 9.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The groups were compared using the Student t-test for continuous variables and chi-squared for categorical variables. Participants were also divided into quartiles of GGT concentration (25th, 50th and 75th percentiles), and the cut-off points were 19, 30 and 49 U/l among men and 15, 21 and 30 U/l among women for the categories of GGT used, respectively. Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to test univariate relations. Prediction of variables was obtained by stepwise, forward,

multiple regression including potential confounders (age, sex, BMI, BPs, lipids, glucose and LVMI). The receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve was determined to evaluate the predictive performance of GGT to detect low CFR. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) and its standard error were calculated. A P value of < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
Results
Clinical characteristics of the study population The general characteristics and risk factors of the groups are presented in Table 1. The following were similar within the lower and higher GGT groups: age, gender, BMI, systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, lipid proﬁles except triglyceride, and hemoglobin. Uric acid and fasting glucose levels were slightly higher, and triglyceride and hsCRP levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the higher GGT group than in the lower GGT group (Table 1).

left ventricular ejection fraction were similar between the lower and higher GGT groups, but LVMI was borderline greater in the higher GGT group than in the lower group. Mitral Amax and mitral E/A ratio were slightly different between the groups (Table 2).
Analysis of coronary ﬂow reserve measurements Baseline and peak heart rate and BPs were similar between the two groups. Baseline diastolic peak ﬂow velocity (DPFV) did not signiﬁcantly differ between the lower and higher GGT groups. However, hyperemic DPFV and CFR were signiﬁcantly higher in the lower GGT group than in the higher GGT group (Table 2).
Relationship between serum g-glutamyltransferase levels and coronary ﬂow reserve GGT levels were inversely and signiﬁcantly correlated with CFR (Fig. 2). In addition, after dividing the patients

into quartile-based GGT concentrations (25th, 50th and 75th percentiles), we showed that CFR decreased progressively with higher GGT levels (2.66 Æ 0.53, 2.53 Æ 0.54, 2.21 Æ 0.34 and 1.98 Æ 0.37; from quartiles 1 to 4, respectively) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in stepwise linear regression analysis, when CFR was taken as dependent, and GGT and other study variables including age, sex, systolic and diastolic BP, LVMI, heart rate, hsCRP and lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDLcholesterol and triglyceride) as independent, we found that only GGT level (b ¼ À0.62, P < 0.0001) and mitral E/A ratio (b ¼ 0.22, P < 0.05) were independently correlated with CFR. We also demonstrated that GGT level was an accurate predictor of low CFR on the receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the curve (AUC) was 79% (95% conﬁdence interval 0.70–0.88), and GGT levels were signiﬁcantly predictive of low CFR (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 4).

Discussion The present study used second harmonic transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE) for CFR determination to evaluate the possible association between serum GGT levels and CFR in arterial hypertension where changes in afterload, renal and LV structure may inﬂuence coronary blood ﬂow supply. Hypertensive subjects were divided into two groups based on the median value of GGT, with the cut-off point 30 for men and 21 for women. The main ﬁndings of the study were that hypertensive subjects with higher GGT had altered CFR, and that an independent association between serum GGT levels and CFR was evident in essential hypertensive individuals, who were newly diagnosed, had never taken any antihypertensive therapy (including diuretics) and did not have any systemic disease except hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study showing an independent association between GGT levels and CFR. Accordingly, CFR was signiﬁcantly different in our hypertensive subjects with lower and higher GGT.

which is a crucial antioxidant defense for the cells [19,20]. In addition, it is well known that substantial oxidative stress exists in hypertension [21]. In line with these suggestions, recent studies have reported that there is a positive association between serum GGT levels and BP [22,23]. In addition, it has recently been shown that there is a relationship between serum GGT levels and microalbuminuria, a marker of hypertensive target organ damage [9].
Coronary endothelial dysfunction resulting in an ineffective vasodilator function is common in hypertensive individuals. Reduced CFR is largely the result of minimal changes in coronary resistance that are independent of vascular tone [11–13]. Hypertensive pressure overload of the left ventricle and coronary circulation has several consequences for the coronary circulation: capillaries and myocytes are likely to suffer damage if perfusion pressure in this part of the coronary circulation is increased, and myocyte hypertrophy leads to an increased distance between arterioles oriented in parallel. The thickening of the wall of resistance vessels can be caused by an increase in the number or diameter of the single smooth muscle cells in the media, leading to an increase in the cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (hypertrophy), or by a reorganization of smooth muscle cells without an increase in the vascular wall area (remodeling) [24–26]. A relative or absolute decrease in the number of resistance vessels per myocardial volume in the presence of chronic increased coronary perfusion pressure may also lead to a normalized terminal perfusion pressure. Otherwise, a diminished number of parallel resistance vessels may reduce vasodilator capacity [26,27]. Taken together, these ﬁndings imply that structural changes in the coronary vasculature are most likely to be the major contributors to impaired CFR. These structural changes may be qualitatively similar to the well-described effects of hypertension on the peripheral circulation [28]. Accordingly, it has been reported that reduced coronary dilatory capacity was associated with increased arteriolar media area, and with perivascular and interstitial ﬁbrosis in patients with arterial hypertension in the absence of relevant coronary artery stenosis [12]. These ﬁndings are surrogate markers of hypertensive target organ damage [12].
Considering the fact that impaired CFR is a surrogate marker of hypertensive target organ damage, and GGT is possibly a marker of oxidative stress and is associated with target organ damage in hypertension, we performed the present study to examine whether GGT is a predictor of impaired CFR among those with newly diagnosed hypertension.
In this study we excluded hypertensive subjects with confounding factors, which are commonly encountered in normal population, such as left ventricular hypertrophy,

diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia and CAD, to investigate the independent association between GGT levels and CFR. Therefore, the study does not provide information about the association between serum GGT levels and CFR in the hypertensive population overall.
In the present study, a relatively low dose of dipyridamole was used for hyperemic stimulus. In addition, dipyridamole mildly dilates epicardial coronary vessels. The standardized pharmacologic protocol of dipyridamole to measure hyperemic coronary ﬂow, and thus the CFR, is still controversial, and a 0.56 mg/kg dose has generally been used in most previous studies [16,29,30]. Thus, we used low-dose dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg over 4 min) for CFR assessment.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated an independent association between serum GGT levels and CFR impairment in untreated essential hypertensive subjects, even in the absence of known CV risk factors. These results support a role for GGT level as an independent marker of target organ damage in hypertension.
