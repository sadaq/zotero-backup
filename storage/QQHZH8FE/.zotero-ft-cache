International efforts aimed at poverty reduction will be
derailed if the rapidly growing global
cardiovascular disease burden is ignored.

In the absence of prevention strategies, increasing numbers of people will succumb
to heart attacks and strokes due to continuing exposure to
risk factors.

Millions of premature deaths due to
cardiovascular disease can be prevented by scaling up the implementation of
affordable, high impact interventions, which already exist.

Foreword

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the biggest cause of deaths worldwide. More than 17 million people died from CVDs in 2008. More than 3 million of these deaths occurred before the age of 60 and could have largely been prevented. The percentage of premature deaths from CVDs ranges from 4% in high-income countries to 42% in low-income countries, leading to growing inequalities in the occurrence and outcome of CVDs between countries and populations.
There are also new dimensions to this alarming situation. Over the past two decades, deaths from CVDs have been declining in high-income countries, but have increased at an astonishingly fast rate in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
CVDs are largely preventable. Both population wide measures and improved access to individual health care interventions can result in a major reduction in the health and socioeconomic burden caused by these diseases and their risk factors. These interventions, which are evidence based and cost effective, are described as best buys in the Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) 2010.
At present, public health services in developing countries are overstretched by increasing demands to cope with heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. At the same time, health care systems in many LMIC are let down by a model based on hospital care focused on the treatment of diseases, often centred around high-technology hospitals that provide extensive treatment for only a small minority of citizens. Hospitals consume huge amounts of resources, and health ministries may spend more than half their budgets on treatment services which depend on hospitals. As a result, a large proportion of people with high cardiovascular risk remain undiagnosed, and even those diagnosed have insufficient access to treatment at the primary health-care level; while evidence suggests two-thirds of premature deaths due to NCDs including CVDs can be prevented by primary prevention and another one-third by improving health systems to respond more effectively and equitably to the healthcare needs of people with NCDs.
Two new developments have led to this report at this juncture. The first development is the growing international awareness that premature deaths from CVDs and other NCDs reduce productivity, curtails economic growth, and pose a significant social challenge in most countries. The second development is that there is now unequivocal evidence that "best buy" interventions to reduce the toll of premature deaths due to CVDs and other NCDs are workable solutions and that they are excellent economic investments -- including in the poorest countries.
As the magnitude of CVDs continue to accelerate globally, the pressing need for increased awareness and for stronger and

more focused international and country responses is increasingly recognized. This atlas on cardiovascular disease prevention and control is part of the response to this need. It documents the magnitude of the problem, using global cardiovascular mortality and morbidity data. It demonstrates the inequities in access to protection, exposure to risk, and access to care as the cause of major inequalities between countries and populations in the occurrence and outcome of CVDs. It also highlights the causes responsible for the declining cardiovascular mortality in developed countries, and sends the message that, to break this cycle of growing inequalities, we must use this knowledge to benefit people in all countries.
Addressing CVDs require concrete and sustained action in three areas which represent the key components of any global or national strategy; surveillance and monitoring, prevention and reduction of risk factors, and improved management and health care through early detection and timely treatment. Actions should include setting national goals and targets and measuring results, advancing multisectoral partnerships and health-in-allpolicies approaches, strengthening health systems and primary health care, and developing the appropriate national capacity and institutional arrangements to manage NCD programmes.
Halting premature deaths from CVDs and other NCDs will also require global solidarity and broad alliances that go beyond national, cultural and ethnic boundaries. Eleven years since the landmark World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Strategy for the Prevention and Control of NCDs to reduce the toll of premature deaths due to CVDs and other NCDs. Heads of State and Government will come together to address the prevention and control of NCDs worldwide at the 2011 High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCDs between 19-20 September 2011 in New York. This is the second time in the history of the United Nations that the General Assembly will meet on a health issue with major socio-economic impact. National leaders are expected to adopt a concise actionoriented outcome document that will shape the international agenda for years to come.
The opportunity provided by the High-level Meeting is unprecedented. By ensuring that the response to CVDs is placed at the forefront of international efforts to promote development and protect health, we will be achieving a more balanced distribution of the benefits of globalization and, in turn, reinforce the broader scope of human security. And this gives me an occasion for great optimism.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) due to atherosclerosis

!
What are cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)?

Key messages
■■ CVDs are the leading causes of death and disability in the world.
■■ Although a large proportion of CVDs is preventable they continue to rise mainly because preventive measures are inadequate.
■■ Out of the 17.3 million cardiovascular deaths in 2008, heart attacks were responsible for 7.3 million and strokes were responsible for 6.2 million deaths.

The normal heart
The heart is a muscular organ about the size of a fist (Figure 1). With every heartbeat, the heart pumps blood that carries oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body. The heart beats about 70 times per minute in a person at rest. The heart rate increases when a person is active or experiences strong emotions. Heart muscle receives its own blood supply from a system of coronary arteries. A good blood supply is vital for the normal function of the heart.

The normal brain
The brain is a complex organ that controls intellectual functions as well as other organ systems (Figure 2). The centralized control of the brain allows the body to make rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Normal function of the brain depends on its blood supply. Two large vessels that run along either side of the neck carry blood from the heart to the brain. The blood vessels branch off into cerebral arteries and carry oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the brain. A good blood supply is vital for the normal function of the brain.

Global Atlas on Cardiovascular Diseases Prevention and Control

CVDs include diseases of the heart, vascular diseases of the brain and diseases of blood vessels. CVDs are responsible for over 17.3 million deaths per year and are the leading causes of death in the world (1) (Figure 3).
The different types of CVDs are listed below.
1. CVDs due to atherosclerosis: ■■ ischaemic heart disease or coronary artery disease (e.g.
heart attack) ■■ cerebrovascular disease (e.g. stroke) ■■ diseases of the aorta and arteries, including hyperten-
sion and peripheral vascular disease.
2. Other CVDs ■■ congenital heart disease ■■ rheumatic heart disease ■■ cardiomyopathies ■■ cardiac arrhythmias.
Deaths due to heart attacks, strokes and other types of CVDs as a proportion of total cardiovascular deaths for males and females are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively (1). Figures 6 and 7 show the global CVD mortality rates in males and females, respectively (1). Figures 8 and 9 show the global disease burden (DALYs) due to CVDs in males and females, respectively (2). The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death (premature death). CVDs and their risk factors are major contributors to global morbidity and mortality (1­–5).
Atherosclerotic disease
The underlying disease process in the blood vessels that results in coronary heart disease (heart attack) and cerebrovascular disease (stroke) is known as atherosclerosis. It is responsible for a large proportion of CVDs. In 2008, out of the 17.3 million cardiovascular deaths, heart attacks were responsible for 7.3 million deaths and strokes were responsible for 6.2 million deaths (1).
Atherosclerosis is a complex pathological process in the walls of blood vessels that develops over many years. In atherosclerosis, fatty material and cholesterol are deposited inside the lumen of medium- and large-sized blood vessels (arteries). These deposits (plaques) cause the inner surface of the blood vessels to become irregular and the lumen to become narrow, making it harder for blood to flow through. Blood vessels also become less pliable as a result. Eventually, the plaque can rupture, triggering the formation of a blood clot. If the blood clot develops in a

coronary artery, it can cause a heart attack; if it develops in the brain, it can cause a stroke.
Factors that promote the process of atherosclerosis are known as risk factors (2–6), and include:
Behavioural risk factors: 1. tobacco use 2. physical inactivity 3. unhealthy diet (rich in salt, fat and calories) 4. harmful use of alcohol.
Metabolic risk factors: 5. raised blood pressure (hypertension) 6. raised blood sugar (diabetes) 7. raised blood lipids (e.g. cholesterol) 8. overweight and obesity.
Other risk factors: 9. poverty and low educational status 10. advancing age 11. gender 12. inherited (genetic) disposition 13. psychological factors (e.g. stress, depression) 14. other risk factors (e.g. excess homocysteine).
There is strong scientific evidence that behavioural and metabolic risk factors play a key role in the aetiology of atherosclerosis.
Rheumatic heart disease
Rheumatic heart disease is caused by damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, following a streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis.
Congenital heart disease
Malformations of heart structures present at birth are known as congenital heart defects. They may be caused by: (i) a close blood relation between parents (consanguinity); (ii) maternal infections (e.g. rubella); (iii) maternal use of alcohol and drugs (e.g. warfarin); and (iv) poor maternal nutrition (e.g. deficiency of folic acid). In some cases the cause remains unknown. Examples of congenital heart disease include holes in the septum of the heart, abnormal valves and abnormalities in heart chambers.
Other CVDs
Other CVDs such as disorders of the heart muscle (e.g. cardiomyopathy), disorders of the electrical conduction system of the heart (e.g. cardiac arrhythmias) and heart valve diseases are less common than heart attacks and strokes.

Death and disability due to CVDs (heart attacks and strokes)

Key messages
■■ CVD is the leading noncommunicable disease ; nearly half of the 36 million deaths due to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are caused by CVDs.
■■ In 2008, nine million people died of NCDs prematurely before the age of 60; some eight million of these premature deaths occurred in lowand middle-income countries (LMICs).
■■ 10% of the global disease burden (DALYs) is attributed to CVD.
■■ Tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets and the harmful use of alcohol are the shared causative risk factors of heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease.

Tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets and the harmful use of alcohol are the main behavioural risk factors of CVDs. These risk factors are shared by other major NCDs such as cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. Long-term exposure to behavioural risk factors results in raised blood pressure (hypertension), raised blood sugar (diabetes), raised and abnormal blood lipids (dyslipidaemia) and obesity. Major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes link CVD to renal disease.
Of the 57 million global deaths in 2008, 36 million (63%) were due to NCDs (Figure 10) and 17.3 million (30%) were due to CVDs. Nearly 80% of NCD deaths occur in LMICs and is the most frequent cause of death in most countries, except in Africa (1). In Africa, NCDs are rising rapidly and are projected to exceed communicable, maternal, perinatal and nutritional diseases as the most common causes of death in another two decades. Over 80% of cardiovascular and diabetes deaths occur in LMICs.
While 29% of NCD deaths occurs among people below the age of 60 in LMICs, in high-income countries only 13% of deaths occur below the age of 60 (1, 6) (Figure 11). Among people below the age of 70, CVDs were responsible for the largest proportion (39%) of NCD deaths (Figure 12). There has been a doubling of CVD rates in LMICs during recent

decades, with rates, for example, for stroke and heart attack exceeding those in high-income countries (1, 6, 7).
According to the Global Burden of Disease estimates (5), 68% of the 751 million years living with disability (YLD) worldwide is attributable to NCDs, and 84% of this burden of NCD disability arises in LMICs. Heart disease is one of the five leading contributors to YLD in elderly people in LMICs. Stroke is also reported as a leading cause of disability in LMICs, second only to dementia. CVDs are responsible for 151 377 million DALYs, of which 62 587 million are due to coronary heart disease and 46 591 million to cerebrovascular disease (2, 5).
The contribution of different CVDs to the global CVDs burden in males and females is shown in Figures 13 and 14, respectively. Figures 15–18 show mortality rates of ischaemic heart disease (Figures 15 and 16) and stroke (Figures 17 and 18) for males and females, respectively. Figures 19–22 show healthy years of life lost due to ischaemic heart disease (Figures 19 and 20) and stroke (Figures 21 and 22) for males and females, respectively.

The underlying pathology of heart attacks and strokes
Atherosclerosis; the underlying basis of heart attacks and strokes
One of the main underlying pathological processes that leads to heart attacks (coronary heart disease) and strokes (cerebrovascular disease) is known as atherosclerosis. The early changes of atherosclerosis develop in childhood and adolescence due to the overall effect of a number of risk factors (4–6). They include tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, raised blood lipids, obesity, poverty, low educational status, advancing age, male gender, genetic disposition and psychological factors.
Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process affecting medium- and large-sized blood vessels throughout the cardiovascular system (8–10). When the lining (endothelium) of these blood vessels is exposed to raised levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) and certain other substances, such as free radicals, the endothelium becomes permeable to lymphocytes and monocytes. These cells migrate into the deep layers of the wall of the blood vessel. A series of reactions occur, attracting LDL cholesterol particles to the site. These particles are engulfed by monocytes, which are then transformed into macrophages (foam cells). Smooth muscle cells migrate to the site from deeper layers of the vessel wall (the media). Later, a fibrous cap consisting of smooth muscle and collagen is formed. At the same time, the macrophages involved in the original reaction begin to die, resulting in the formation of a necrotic core covered by the fibrous cap. These lesions (atheromatous plaques) enlarge as cells and lipids accumulate in them and the plaque

Key messages
■■ Tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, together with ageing and genetic factors, promote atherosclerosis and narrowing of the blood vessels.
■■ The process of atherosclerosis starts in childhood and adolescence and manifests as heart attacks and strokes in later years.
begins to bulge into the vessel lumen (Figures 23–26). When the process continues, there is thinning of the fibrous cap accompanied by fissuring of the endothelial surface of the plaque, which may rupture. With the rupture of the plaque, lipid fragments and cellular debris are released into the vessel lumen. These are exposed to thrombogenic agents on the endothelial surface, resulting in the formation of a thrombus. If the thrombus is large enough, and a coronary blood vessel or a cerebral blood vessel is blocked, this results in a heart attack or stroke (9, 10).
Heart attack
When the blood flow to the heart is cut off, due to a thrombus on a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, the decrease in the supply of oxygen and nutrients can damage the heart muscle, resulting in a heart attack. When the blood flow is decreased due to a blockage, it causes chest pain (angina) due to ischaemia.
Stroke
The pathophysiology of ischaemic stroke is more diverse and includes, besides thrombus formation in atherosclerotic cerebral blood vessels (ischaemic stroke), small vessel disease in the brain linked to vascular risk factors. Another cause of stroke is haemorrhage (bleeding) due to a rupture of a blood vessel because of the presence of an aneurysm, for example, or due to damage from uncontrolled high blood pressure or atherosclerosis (haemorrhagic stroke). In addition, strokes can also be caused by a travelling blood clot. If a person has an irregular heartbeat, blood clots may form in the heart and travel through the blood vessels to the brain. A clot carried to the cerebral circulation in this way can be trapped in a cerebral blood vessel and block the blood flow to an area of the brain.

Evidence for prevention of heart attacks and strokes

Key messages
■■ CVDs are eminently preventable. ■■ Investment in prevention is the most
sustainable solution for the CVD epidemic. ■■ Over the last two decades, CVD mortality has declined in developed countries due to a combination of prevention and control measures.

Figures 27 and 28 show mortality rates of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Over the past two decades, cardiovascular mortality rates have declined substantially in high-income countries (6, 11–13). There is clear evidence that population-wide primary prevention and individual health-care intervention strategies have both contributed to these declining mortality trends. For example, during the 10-year period covered by the World Health Organization (WHO) Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease initiative (WHO MONICA Project), mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke declined dramatically in many of the 38 MONICA populations (13).
The decline in mortality has been attributed to reduced incidence rates and/or improved survival after cardiovascular events due to prevention and treatment interventions. Across all populations with declining coronary heart disease mortality, reduced cardiovascular risk contributed to 75% and 66% of the change in men and women, respectively; the remainder being attributed to providing health care resulting in improved survival in the first four weeks after the event. For stroke, about one third of the changes in populations with declining mortality was attributed to reduced incidence and 66% to improved survival.

There has been a dramatic decline in coronary heart disease mortality in the United Kingdom from 1981 to 2000 (14). Nearly 42% of this decrease has been attributed to treatment (including 11% to secondary prevention, 13% to heart failure treatment, 8% to initial treatment of acute myocardial infarction and 3% to hypertension treatment). About 58% of the decline has been attributed to population-wide risk factor reductions (14).
The above data and similar experiences in Finland (15) and other countries (16, 17) strongly support the view that population-wide primary prevention and individual healthcare approaches go hand-in-hand to reduce the population burden of CVDs (6).

Reducing cardiovascular risk to prevent heart attacks and strokes

Key messages
■■ Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia cluster together and are major risk factors for strokes and heart attacks.
■■ To prevent heart attacks and strokes, the total cardiovascular risk needs to be reduced by lowering all modifiable risk factors.
■■ Prevention of heart attacks and strokes by reducing the total cardiovascular risk is cost effective.

A large percentage of CVDs (and other NCDs) is preventable through the reduction of behavioural risk factors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol) (3, 6).
Unhealthy behaviours lead to metabolic/physiological changes: raised blood pressure (hypertension); overweight/obesity; raised blood sugar (diabetes); and raised blood lipids (dyslipidaemia). These intermediate risk factors cause damage to coronary and cerebral blood vessels due to atherosclerosis, a process that develops over many years, starting in childhood and manifesting as heart attacks and strokes in people of middle age. Since the underlying pathological process that causes heart attacks and strokes is similar, common approaches that address behavioural risk factors and metabolic risk factors are effective for prevention of both conditions.
In terms of attributable deaths, the leading cardiovascular risk factor globally is raised blood pressure (to which 13% of global deaths is attributed), followed by tobacco use (9%), raised blood glucose (6%), physical inactivity (6%) and overweight and obesity (5%) (2) (Figure 29).
These behavioural and metabolic risk factors often coexist in the same person and act synergistically to increase the individual’s total risk of developing acute vascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Strong scientific evi-

dence demonstrates that reducing total cardiovascular risk results in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes (4).
Pioneering work conducted by the Framingham Heart Study project in the United States (18, 19) and the Seven Countries study (20) in the 1960s and many other studies since then, including the WHO MONICA Project (13) and the INTERHEART study (21), have provided further insights into the risk factors and determinants of CVDs.
If people at risk of developing myocardial infarctions and strokes can be identified and measures taken to reduce their cardiovascular risk, a vast majority of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events can be prevented (4, 21, 22). WHO ISH (International Society of Hypertension) risk prediction charts and other risk prediction tools can be used to assess the risk of developing heart attacks and strokes (Figure 30).
Cardiovascular risk distribution of the population can be lowered through national health policies targeting the whole population as well as those at high risk (Figure 31). Population-wide strategies should address behavioural risk factors. Simultaneously, those at high risk need to be identified and targeted through health systems using integrated risk assessment and management approaches that are cost effective (4, 6, 23). Figure 32 shows the distribution of the population across different levels of cardiovascular risk in all WHO regions.

Tobacco: The totally avoidable risk factor of CVDs

Key messages
■■ Tobacco use is a principal contributor to the development of heart attacks, strokes, sudden death, heart failure, aortic aneurysm and peripheral vascular disease.
■■ Smoking cessation and avoidance of second-hand smoke reduce the cardiovascular risk and thereby help to prevent CVDs.

There are currently about one billion smokers in the world. Manufactured cigarettes represent the major form of smoked tobacco; other forms of tobacco consumed include “bidis” (a type of filter-less hand-rolled cigarette), cigars, hookahs and chewed tobacco (24, 25). Figure 33 and 34 show the prevalence rates of current daily tobacco smoking. The prevalence of daily tobacco smoking varied widely among the six WHO regions in 2009.
The highest overall prevalence for smoking is estimated at nearly 31% in the WHO European Region, while the lowest is in the WHO African Region at 10% (26).
Risks to health from tobacco use result not only from direct consumption of tobacco, but also from exposure to second-hand smoke (24, 25). Nearly six million people die from tobacco use and exposure to second hand smoke each year, accounting for 6% of all female and 12% of all male deaths in the world (1, 6). By 2030, tobacco-related deaths are projected to increase to more than 8 million deaths every year (2, 6).
Smoking is estimated to cause nearly 10% of CVD (2). There is a large body of evidence from prospective cohort studies regarding the beneficial effect of smoking cessation on coronary heart disease mortality (4). A 50-year follow-up of British doctors demonstrated that, among ex-smokers, the age of quitting has a major impact on survival prospects:

those who quit between 35 and 44 years of age had the same survival rates as those who had never smoked (27).
There is an inverse relationship between income level and prevalence of tobacco use and its related consequences. In addition, tobacco consumption inflicts a greater harm among disadvantaged groups due to tobacco-related illness and the impact on household expenditure. Therefore, policies and interventions focusing on prevention of tobacco use, promotion of smoke free environments and smoking cessation should be important components of national and international efforts to improve the health and well being of populations, especially the less affluent (28).

Physical inactivity: A preventable risk factor of CVDs

Key messages
■■ Regular physical activity reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
■■ Physical activity is a key determinant of energy expenditure and thus fundamental to energy balance and weight control.

Insufficient physical activity can be defined as less than 5 times 30 minutes of moderate activity per week, or less than 3 times 20 minutes of vigorous activity per week, or equivalent. Insufficient physical activity is the f­­ourth leading risk factor for mortality. Approximately 3.2 million deaths and 32.1 million DALYs – representing about 2.1% of global DALYs – each year are attributable to insufficient physical activity (2). People who are insufficiently physically active have a 20% to 30% increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to those who engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity most days of the week. In 2008, 31.3% of adults aged 15 or older (28.2% men and 34.4% women) were insufficiently physically active (6).
In adults, participation in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week (or equivalent) is estimated to reduce the risk of ischaemic heart disease by approximately 30% and the risk of diabetes by 27% (4).
Many studies that have examined the association between physical activity and CVDs (4, 6, 29–32) have reported reduced risk of death from coronary heart disease and reduced risk of overall CVDs, coronary heart disease and stroke, in a dose–response fashion. Physical activity is a key determinant of energy expenditure and thus fundamental to energy balance and weight control. Physical activity improves endothelial function, which enhances vasodilata-

tion and vasomotor function in the blood vessels (33). In addition, physical activity contributes to weight loss, glycaemic control, improved blood pressure, lipid profile and insulin sensitivity (34, 35). The beneficial effects of physical activity on cardiovascular risk may be mediated, at least in part, through these effects on intermediate risk factors.
The Global Status Report on NCD (6) showed that the prevalence of insufficient physical activity was highest in the WHO Region of the Americas and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. In all WHO regions, men are more active than women, with the biggest difference in prevalence between males and females in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (Figures 35 and 36).
The prevalence of insufficient physical activity is higher in high-income countries compared to low-income countries due to increased automation of work and use of vehicles for transport in high-income countries. High-income countries have more than double the prevalence of insufficient physical activity compared to low-income countries for both men and women, with 41% of men and 48% of women being insufficiently physically active in high-income countries compared to 18% of men and 21% of women in low-income countries (6).

Harmful use of alcohol: A preventable risk factor of CVDs

Key messages
■■ 14% of alcohol-attributable deaths globally are due to CVD and diabetes mellitus.
■■ There is a direct causal relationship between levels and patterns of alcohol consumption and risk of CVD.
■■ High levels of alcohol consumption and heavy episodic (binge) drinking are associated with increased risk of CVD.
■■ Harmful use of alcohol damages the heart muscle, increases the risk of stroke and promotes cardiac arrhythmia.

The harmful use of alcohol is a risk factor for multiple adverse health and social outcomes, including hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, neuropathy, encephalopathy, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, sudden infant death syndrome, violence, suicide and unintentional injuries (e.g. motor vehicle crashes). In addition, people are affected by other people's drinking, including that of their families, friends, co-workers and strangers. These harms range in magnitude from noise and fear to physical abuse, sexual coercion and social isolation (2–6, 36). The adult per capita consumption of pure alcohol (litres) is shown in Figure 37.
Hazardous and harmful drinking was responsible for 2.5 million (3.8%) deaths worldwide in 2004 (2,37,38). More than 50% of these deaths were due to CVDs, liver cirrhosis and cancer. An estimated 4.5% of the global burden of disease – as measured in DALYs – is caused by the harmful use of alcohol (2).
The relationship between alcohol consumption and coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases is complex. It depends on both the level and the pattern of alcohol consumption. There is a direct relationship between higher levels of alcohol consumption and the pattern of binge

drinking (defined as 60 or more grams of pure alcohol per day) with the risk of CVD. Drinking at low levels without episodes of heavy drinking may be associated with a reduced risk of multiple cardiovascular outcomes (overall mortality from CVDs, incidence of and mortality from coronary heart disease and incidence of and mortality from stroke) in some segments of the population (36–38). However, these effects tend to disappear if the patterns of drinking are characterized by heavy episodic drinking (39, 40).
Various mechanisms have been proposed for the protective effect of light to moderate alcohol consumption, including the beneficial effects of alcohol on the HDL cholesterol level, thrombolytic profile and platelet aggregation (39–42).
Overall alcohol consumption is associated with multiple health risks that, at the population level, clearly outweigh potential benefits.

Unhealthy diet: A preventable risk factor of CVDs

Key messages
■■ A modest reduction in salt intake reduces blood pressure in individuals with both normal and raised blood pressure.
■■ Dietary salt increases blood pressure in most people with hypertension and in about one third with normotension.
■■ Dietary salt aggravates the agerelated rise in blood pressure.
■■ High dietary intakes of saturated fat, trans-fat, cholesterol and salt, and low intake of fruits, vegetables and fish increase the risk of CVD.

There is a considerable body of evidence regarding the nutritional background of atherosclerosis in general and coronary heart disease in particular. High dietary intakes of saturated fat, trans-fat cholesterol and salt, and low intake of fruits, vegetables and fish are linked to cardiovascular risk (2–6, 43). Obesity is a cardiovascular risk factor closely linked to diet and physical inactivity. Obesity results, when there is an imbalance between energy intake in the diet and energy expenditure. Regular physical activity can prevent obesity by increasing the expended energy. Figures 38 and 39 show the prevalence of obesity in adults and Figure 40 shows the per capita intake of fruits and vegetables.
Approximately 16 million (1.0%) DALYs and 1.7 million (2.8%) of deaths worldwide are attributable to low fruit and vegetable consumption (2). The amount of dietary salt consumed is an important determinant of blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk (43–45). Adequate consumption of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of CVD (2, 46, 47). Frequent consumption of high-energy foods, such as processed foods that are high in fats and sugars, promotes obesity compared to low-energy foods (48). A healthy diet can contribute to a healthy body weight, a desirable lipid profile and a desirable blood pressure (44).
WHO recommends a population salt intake of less than 5 grams/person/day to help the prevention of CVD (43).

However, data from various countries indicate that most populations are consuming much more salt than this (44). It is estimated that decreasing dietary salt intake from the current global levels of 9–12 grams/day to the recommended level of 5 grams/day would have a major impact on blood pressure and CVD (45, 49).
A modest reduction in salt intake has a significant, and from a population viewpoint, important effect on blood pressure in individuals with either normal or raised blood pressure (50). There is also a correlation between the magnitude of salt reduction and the magnitude of blood pressure reduction within the daily intake range of 3–12 grams/day; the lower the salt intake, the lower the blood pressure (49, 50).
High consumption of saturated fats and trans-fatty acids is linked to heart disease; elimination of trans-fat and replacement of saturated with polyunsaturated vegetable oils lowers coronary heart disease risk (43).
Energy from saturated fats usually accounts for one third of the energy from total fat, with the notable exception of the WHO South-East Asia Region, where saturated fatty acids account for over 40% of total fat intake. The availability of total fat increases with income level, with the availability of saturated fats around 8% in low- and lower-middle-income countries and 10% in upper-middle-income and in highincome countries (6, 43).

Obesity: A risk factor of CVDs

Key messages
■■ Obesity is strongly related to major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.
■■ Imbalance between increased energy intake (diet) and energy expenditure (physical activity) is the major cause of obesity.
■■ Obesity is a growing health problem worldwide.

Worldwide, at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese, and an estimated 35.8 million (2.3%) of global DALYs are caused by overweight or obesity (6). In 2008, 34% of adults over the age of 20 were overweight with a body mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 (33.6% of men and 35% of women). In 2008, 9.8% of men and 13.8% of women were obese (with a BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2), compared to 4.8% for men and 7.9% for women in 1980 (6).
Obesity is a growing health problem in both developed and developing countries (6). Figures 41 and 42 show the world distribution of the prevalence of overweight. Prospective epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between overweight or obesity and cardiovascular morbidity, CVD mortality and total mortality. Obesity is strongly related to major cardiovascular risk factors such as raised blood pressure, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia (4, 6, 51–53).
Overweight and obesity cause adverse metabolic effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin resistance. Risks of coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke and type 2 diabetes mellitus increase steadily with an increasing BMI (54). To achieve optimal health, the median BMI for adult populations should be in the range of

21–23 kg/m2, while the goal for individuals should be to maintain a BMI in the range 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 (4).
The prevalence of raised BMI increases with income level of countries, up to upper-middle-income levels. The prevalence of overweight in high-income and upper-middleincome countries was more than double that of low- and lower-middle-income countries. For obesity, the difference more than triples from 7% obesity for both males and females in lower-middle-income countries to 24% in uppermiddle-income countries (6). Rising income is associated with rising rates of overweight among infants and young children. In high-income countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, lower socioeconomic status is associated with a higher prevalence of obesity (55, 56). In contrast, in medium- and low-income countries a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity in men, women and children has been observed.

Raised blood pressure (hypertension): A major risk factor of CVDs

Key messages
■■ Raised blood pressure is a major risk factor for strokes and heart attacks as well as heart failure, renal impairment, peripheral vascular disease and blindness.
■■ There is a continuous relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular risk (risk of developing heart attacks and strokes).
■■ Early detection of hypertension and treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk in people with hypertension is vital for prevention of strokes and heart attacks.

Worldwide, raised blood pressure is estimated to cause 7.5 million deaths, about 12.8% of the total of all annual deaths (2, 6). This accounts for 57 million DALYS or 3.7% of total DALYS. Raised blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (4). Blood pressure levels have been shown to be positively and progressively related to the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. In some age groups, the risk of CVD doubles for each incremental increase of 20/10 mmHg of blood pressure, starting as low as 115/75 mmHg. In addition to coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled blood pressure causes heart failure, renal impairment, peripheral vascular disease and damage to retinal blood vessels and visual impairment (1–6, 57).
Figures 43 and 44 show the distribution of prevalence of raised blood pressure in the world in adult males and females, respectively. Globally, the overall prevalence of raised blood pressure in adults aged 25 and over was around 40% in 2008. The number of people with uncontrolled hypertension has risen from 600 million in 1980 to nearly one billion in 2008 (6). Undetected and uncontrolled hypertension that increases the cardiovascular risk is a major contributor to stroke worldwide (6).
The prevalence of raised blood pressure was highest in the WHO African Region, where it was 46% for males and

females combined. The lowest prevalence of raised blood pressure was in the WHO Region of the Americas, with 35% for both males and females. Across the income groups of countries, the prevalence of raised blood pressure was consistently high, with low-, lower-middle- and upper-middleincome countries all having rates of around 40% for males and females. The prevalence in high-income countries was lower, at 35% for both genders (6).
Policies to reduce salt consumption can shift the population distribution of blood pressure so that there is a reduction in cardiovascular risk (4). The stroke and heart attack risk of people with high cardiovascular risk and/or raised blood pressure can be reduced through non-pharmacological (e.g. low salt diet, physical activity) and pharmacological measures. These measures are very important for people with diabetes as they are particularly vulnerable to heart attacks and strokes. Primary care access to cardiovascular risk assessment and essential medicines for reducing cardiovascular risk can improve health outcomes of people with hypertension (6).

Raised blood sugar (diabetes): A major risk factor of CVDs

Key messages
■■ The risk of cardiovascular events is two to threefold higher in people with diabetes and the risk is disproportionately higher in women.
■■ Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia increase the risk for future development of diabetes and CVD.
■■ Early detection and treatment of diabetes, including reduction of cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes, is vital for prevention of heart attacks and strokes and other complications of diabetes.

Diabetes is a major risk factor of CVD. Diabetes is defined as having a fasting plasma glucose value ≥ 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl). Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia are risk categories for future development of diabetes and CVD (4).
In 2008, diabetes was responsible for 1.3 million deaths globally. The magnitude of diabetes and other abnormalities of glucose tolerance would be considerably higher than the above estimate if the categories of “impaired fasting” and “impaired glucose tolerance” were included. In 2008, the global prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 10% (6).
The estimated prevalence of diabetes is relatively consistent across the income groupings of countries. Lowincome countries showed the lowest prevalence (8% for both males and females), and the upper-middle-income countries showed the highest prevalence (10% for both males and females). The prevalence of raised blood glucose worldwide is shown in Figures 45 and 46).
CVD accounts for about 60% of all mortality in people with diabetes. The risk of cardiovascular events is from two to three times higher in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and the risk is disproportionately higher in women (58–60). In some age groups, people with diabetes have a twofold increase in the risk of stroke (4). Patients with diabetes also

have a poorer prognosis after cardiovascular events compared to people without diabetes.
Cardiovascular risk increases with raised glucose values (61, 62). Furthermore, abnormal glucose regulation tends to occur together with other known cardiovascular risk factors such as central obesity, elevated blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol and a high triglyceride level (63–66).
Lack of early detection and care for diabetes results in severe complications, including heart attacks, strokes, renal failure, amputations and blindness. Primary care access to measurement of blood glucose and cardiovascular risk assessment as well as essential medicines including insulin can improve health outcomes of people with diabetes (6).

■■ There is continuous association between total cholesterol and cardiovascular risk.
■■ Lowering cholesterol in people with moderate-high cardiovascular risk prevents heart attacks and strokes.

cholesterol:

A major risk factor of CVDs

The lipoprotein profile includes: (i) low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), also called “bad” cholesterol); (ii) high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), also called “good” cholesterol); and (iii) triglycerides. Excess calories in the body are converted into triglycerides and stored in fat cells throughout the body.
LDL cholesterol is deposited in the walls of arteries and causes atherosclerosis. In general, lower LDL cholesterol numbers are better for vascular health. HDL cholesterol protects against vascular disease by removing the “bad” cholesterol out of the walls of arteries. Total blood cholesterol is a measure of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and other lipid components. High triglycerides increase the risk of atherosclerotic CVD.
Raised blood cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease and stroke (4). Globally, one third of ischaemic heart disease is attributable to high cholesterol (2, 5). Overall, raised cholesterol is estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths (4.5% of total) and 29.7 million DALYS, or 2% of total DALYS globally (2). In 2008, the prevalence of raised total cholesterol among adults – defined as total cholesterol ≥ 6.2 mmol/l (240 mg/dl) – was 9.7% (8.5% for males and 10.7% for females) (6).
Lowering raised serum cholesterol reduces the risk of heart disease. For example, a 10% reduction in serum cholesterol

in 40-year old men has been reported to result in a 50% reduction in heart disease within five years; the same serum cholesterol reduction for 70-year old men can result in an average 20% reduction in heart disease occurrence within five years (6).
In 2008, the global prevalence of raised total cholesterol among adults was 39% (37% for males and 40% for females). The prevalence of raised cholesterol in males and females in different parts of the world is shown in Figures 47 and 48, respectively. Globally, mean total cholesterol changed little between 1980 and 2008, falling by less than 0.1 mmol/l per decade in males and females. The prevalence of elevated total cholesterol was highest in the WHO European Region (54% for both genders), followed by the WHO Region of the Americas (48% for both genders). The WHO African Region and the WHO South-East Asia Region showed the lowest percentages (23% and 30%, respectively) (6).
The prevalence of raised total cholesterol noticeably increases according to the income level of the country (6). In low-income countries, around 25% of adults have raised total cholesterol, while in high-income countries, over 50% of adults have raised total cholesterol (6, 67).

Social determinants and CVDs

Key messages
■■ Choices that people make regarding behaviour (tobacco use, use of alcohol, physical activity or diet) are shaped by the “opportunities” that society offers to them.
■■ Poverty, lack of education and unplanned urbanization have a negative impact on cardiovascular health.
■■ Unfair distribution of power, money and resources increases exposure to cardiovascular risk factors.

Social determinants such as the distribution of income or the level of education indirectly influence cardiovascular health as well as health in general. These determinants shape a set of socioeconomic positions within hierarchies of power, prestige and access to resources. Several structural mechanisms are responsible for creating the differential social positions of individuals, including governance, education systems, labour market structures and the presence or absence of redistributive welfare policies. Social stratification shapes individual health status as well as CVD outcomes by impacting behavioural and metabolic cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial status, living conditions and the health system (68).
In 2005, WHO convened the Commission on Social Determinants of Health to provide advice on how to reduce health inequities. The final report of the Commission (69) made three overarching recommendations: (i) to improve daily living conditions; (ii) to tackle the unequal distribution of power, money and resources; and (iii) to monitor health inequities. WHO Member States discussed the report and passed a resolution urging action on social determinants at the 2009 World Health Assembly (WHA) (70). The resolution called for a “Health in All Policies” approach and a renewed commitment to intersectoral action to reduce health ineq-

uities as well as the implementation of a social determinants approach across public health programmes.
Poverty, low rates of literacy (Figure 49), environmental degradation, poor housing and unplanned urbanization have a negative impact on health (68, 69, 71, 72). For example, children from lower socioeconomic strata have a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease and people living in poor housing develop Chagas cardiomyopathy. The poor, have limited opportunities for healthy choices and have a high prevalence of smoking (Figure 50).
To mount an effective response to address social determinants that impact health, governance and systems need to be put in place that deliver a wide range of intersectoral actions. Promoting participation and leadership of communities and civil society groups in decision-making are key aspects of the governance necessary for action on social determinants. Such an inclusive and responsible approach would contribute to the implementation of coherent policies that increase opportunities for people and create a fairer society and healthier populations.

Risk factors take root in the womb, childhood and youth

Key messages
■■ Improving the nutrition of girls and women could prevent CVD in future generations.
■■ Implementation of policies to promote healthy lifestyles in children and youth is essential for prevention of CVD.
■■ Undernutrition in fetal life and infancy increases an individual’s vulnerability to CVD.
■■ Healthy behaviours are learned in childhood and continue into adulthood.

Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of adult diabetes and CVD. There is increasing evidence that exposure to undernutrition in early life increases an individual’s vulnerability to these disorders by “programming” permanent metabolic changes (73–75). The fetus depends on the mother for its nutrition and adapts to inadequate nutrition by prioritization of brain growth at the expense of other tissues such as the abdominal organs and by altered secretion and sensitivity to the fetal growth hormones, insulin and upregulation of the hypothalamo-pituitaryadrenal “stress” axis. The fetus sacrifices tissues that require high-quality building blocks, such as muscle or bone, and instead lays down less demanding tissue, such as fat. These changes can become “programmed” because they occur during critical periods of early development and can lead to adult CVD, or render the individual more susceptible to the effects of environmental and behavioural risk factors.
Behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use and dietary habits are learned in childhood and continue into adulthood. In many countries, metabolic risk factors such as obesity and diabetes are starting to appear at early ages (76, 77). In 2008, global estimates for overweight among infants and young children indicated that there were 40 million (or 6%) preschool children with a weight-forheight above more than two standard deviations of the WHO child growth standards median (6). Children spend a substantial portion of their time watching television, which can contribute to obesity through displacement of physical activity and increased calorie consumption while watching or caused by the effects of advertising (Figures

51 and 52). Children also have no control over exposure to passive cigarette smoke.
When exposed to risk factors, changes of atherosclerosis within blood vessels have been shown to begin in the first decade of life as fatty streaks and plaques (7). These lesions have been shown to regress through modification of behavioural risk factors.
Many WHA resolutions address the protection of children and youth from health risks (3, 78–81): ■■ WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control
(FCTC); resolution WHA56.1; ■■ Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol,

However, development and implementation of policies and strategies at the country level to protect the health and well-being of pregnant women, children and youth remain inadequate. Undernutrition in fetal life and infancy increases an individual’s vulnerability to CVD. Healthy behaviours such as physical activity are learned in childhood and continue into adulthood.

Heart attacks and strokes in women

There are many misconceptions about CVDs in women. In reality, CVDs affect as many men as women. However, women loose less years of life due to CVDs as the disease develops about 7-10 years later in women compared to men (4, 6) (Figure 53). Risk factors of CVDs are similar for men and women. Every year, 3.3 million women die of heart attacks and 3.2 million die of strokes globally.
Gender norms and roles influence these risk factors as women, in some contexts, do not have access to and control over resources that can diminish their exposure to the risk factors. For example, women’s multiple roles in the household and workplace community may diminish their ability to engage in meaningful physical activity. Social expectations relating to mobility and norms about permitted clothing influence the ability of girls and women to participate in sports and developing a lifelong habit that values physical activity.
In the developing world, tobacco use rates for adult females remain relatively low, but could rise quickly among teenage females (25). Aggressive campaigns by the tobacco industry, which targeted women and girls increasingly over the years, have contributed to such increases and are of great public health concern.
The risk of heart disease and stroke in women are often underestimated because of the mistaken notion that females are protected from CVDs. There may be certain differences

in the clinical presentation of CVD in women leading to inadequate diagnostic and treatment interventions (82). Better self-awareness in women regarding identification of their cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms can improve early detection. There is evidence that CVD is underdetected in women and that there are delays in referral, hospitalization, diagnosis and invasive treatment compared to men (83–86). Women with CVD living in developing countries experience specific challenges in accessing cost-effective prevention, early detection and treatment due to gender inequality, family responsibilities and the costs of seeking care. These factors are made worse by health systems that fail to respond to specific needs of women.
Women, although responsible for household food procurement and preparation in most societies, may not have access to the requisite information about healthy food. Women are responsible for rearing children, including how time is used and development of health promoting habits. Such habits are often not passed along if women are not specifically targeted as both beneficiaries and significant gatekeepers for health promotion to other members of their families. Their potential role as “change agents” of families and communities with respect to healthy behaviours is often underutilized.

of CVDs: Ageing,

globalization and urbanization

Mortality due to CVD has declined in high-income countries during the last three decades, while the cardiovascular epidemic continues to increase in other countries to the extent that the majority of the disease burden from CVD is found in LMICs. This situation primarily results from tremendous global shifts in demographics with the ageing of populations (Figure 54) and accompanied by urbanization (Figure 55) and the globalization of unhealthy behaviours, producing an explosive increase in the population prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and subsequent disease (1, 2, 6).
Age is a powerful cardiovascular risk factor. The rapidly growing burden of CVD in LMICs is accelerated by population ageing. According to United Nations (UN) projections, in 2025 there will be 1.2 billion elderly people worldwide, with 71% of them likely to be in developing countries (87).
CVD is also driven by the negative effects of unregulated globalization and unplanned urbanization (88, 89). For example, irresponsible marketing supported by multinational food cooperations is targeting children and adolescents to promote consumption of “junk” food with high levels of energy, fat and salt. Similarly, well-funded advertising campaigns of tobacco companies are targeting women to promote tobacco smoking. Financial and economic globalization also has an influence on trade, national income,

national economic performance and household income. National income is particularly important for prevention and control of CVD because of its impact on public sector resources available for health care.
Rapid, unplanned urbanization also promotes unhealthy behaviours i) by limiting healthy food choices ii) by not providing environments conducive to physical activity iii) by causing exposure to air pollutants (including tobacco smoke) and the harmful use of alcohol (90). Many governments and municipalities are unable to keep pace with rapidly expanding needs for infrastructure and services and overlook the fact that urban planning is needed to support health behaviours. As a consequence, people are exposed to risks and denied healthy choices in terms of diet and physical activity.

Inequities and CVDs

Key messages
■■ CVD affect the poor as well as the rich. ■■ Inequities of power, money and
resources impact the health status and the development of CVD. ■■ Disadvantaged populations are more exposed to cardiovascular risk due to lack of power and knowledge. ■■ Unfair policy choices are the root causes of health inequities.

Socioeconomic stratification has been consistently associated with differences in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, CVD incidence and mortality across multiple populations (91–96). CVD and its risk factors were originally more common in upper socioeconomic groups in the developed world, but this pattern has reversed over the last 50 years. Those in low socioeconomic positions have a poorer risk factor profile, including greater levels of hypertension and diabetes and a trend towards higher rates of smoking compared to those of higher socioeconomic positions (6, 97). The inverse association between socioeconomic status and CVD is strongest for incidence and mortality of stroke, with low socioeconomic groups showing lower survival and higher stroke incidence in many populations in developed countries (93, 95, 96).
From the moment of conception, during intrauterine life and over the course of a lifetime, the cumulative risk of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease develops by way of a complex interplay of genetics, in utero environment, biological risk factors and social determinants. Disadvantaged populations are more exposed to risks (tobacco use, use of alcohol, physical activity or diet). The extent of exposure is shaped by the“opportunities”that society offers to individuals (97). In addition to unhealthy behaviours, disadvantaged groups have limited access to social support, lack of perception of control and greater job stress, lower health-seeking behaviours, less access to medical care and greater comorbidity (98).

There are differences in exposure to health risks and health outcomes between different population groups that are avoidable, unfair and remediable (99–107). Unfair policy choices are often the root causes of these differences. Even in countries where the conditions for universal health coverage are broadly achieved, inequities persist between different socioeconomic, ethnic and geographic groups.
Figure 56 shows the Gini index of national income distribution around the world. The Gini index is a measure of the inequality of a distribution (0 = equality and 100 = inequality). Figure 57 shows the CVD mortality by World Bank income groups and the higher Gini index (higher income inequality)in low income countries compared to high income countries. Figure 58 shows the association between stroke mortality rates and national income.
Several complementary approaches in health and other sectors are required to address inequities. First, policy and structural interventions must address root social causes such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and deprived neighbourhoods. Second, protecting the cardiovascular health of lower socioeconomic groups through population-based prevention strategies needs to be a priority. Third, health system delivery of primary and secondary prevention interventions must pay special attention to disadvantaged groups. And fourth, resources need to be earmarked for improving the health of disadvantaged groups who may lack political power for making the case for sufficient funding.

Cardiac arrhythmia

Key messages
■■ The percentage of strokes attributable to atrial fibrillation increases with age, and in the elderly it accounts for about one fifth of all strokes.
■■ Coronary artery disease is a cause of cardiac arrhythmia.
■■ Sudden death due to a cardiac arrhythmia may be the first sign of coronary artery disease.

Each heartbeat originates as an electrical impulse in the right atrium of the heart in the area called the sino atrial node. The impulse initially causes both of the atria to contract, then activates the atrioventricular node and the electrical impulse spreads through both ventricles via the bundle of His and the Purkinje fibres causing a synchronized contraction of the ventricles of the heart.
Abnormal electrical activity in the heart is known as cardiac arrhythmia; the heartbeat may be too fast or too slow, and may be regular or irregular. It may originate from the region of the atria or ventricles. Sometimes cardiac arrhythmia is life threatening and causes medical emergencies, sometimes it may not cause symptoms or it may give rise to palpitations. Atrial fibrillation is one of the common tachyarrhythmias arising from the atria (Figure 59). It is characterized by predominantly uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of mechanical function of the heart (108).
The prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with advancing age to a prevalence of about 9% for ages 80–89 (108). Other risk factors of atrial fibrillation include hypertension, diabetes, thyroid overactivity and cardiac valve abnormalities. Atrial fibrillation is commonly associated with, and complicated by, stroke and congestive heart failure. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke fivefold. The incidence

of stroke attributable to atrial fibrillation increases from 1.5% for ages 50–59 to 23.5% for ages 80–89 (108, 109). If electrocardiography facilities are available, atrial fibrillation can be diagnosed by opportunistic and targeted screening in primary care. Once atrial fibrillation is diagnosed, drugs are given to control the heart rate and anticoagulants are given to prevent stroke (110).
Heart attacks may present as ventricular arrhythmias. Sudden cardiac death due to such arrhythmias is an important cause of cardiovascular mortality. Electrical defibrillation is required to restore coordinated activity of the heart in these cases and even short delays in defibrillation significantly deteriorate outcome. To enable early out-of-hospital defibrillation, automated external defibrillators are increasingly made available for public use in highly frequented places in developed countries (111, 112).
However, public access defibrillation programmes are expensive and the marginal improvements in survival do not justify spending the limited financial resources for widescale deployment of automated external defibrillation in resource-constrained settings. In such settings, more funds need to be diverted to strengthening programmes for prevention of CVD in order to reduce the need for defibrillation programmes (112–114).

Congenital heart disease

Key messages
■■ A significant proportion of congenital heart disease can be prevented by public health measures such as rubella vaccination, promotion of universal use of salt fortified with iodine and promotion of staple food fortified with folic acid.
■■ Policies to optimize women’s diet before and throughout pregnancy are critical for prevention of congenital heart disease.

Congenital heart disease is a defect in the structure and function of the heart due to abnormal heart development before birth. With an incidence ranging from 19 to 75 per 1000 live births, congenital heart disease is an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide (115). Congenital heart disease is the leading cause of birth defects. When infectious diseases are excluded, congenital heart disease accounts for more deaths in the first year of life than any other condition (1, 116).
Birth defects can be caused by single gene defects, chromosomal disorders, multifactorial inheritance, environmental teratogens and micronutrient deficiencies (115, 116). Maternal infectious diseases such as syphilis and rubella are also significant causes of birth defects in LMICs. Diabetes mellitus and iodine and folic acid deficiency in the mother as well as exposure to medicines and recreational drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, certain environmental chemicals and high doses of radiation, are other factors that cause birth defects (116).
The majority of congenital heart diseases presents as an isolated defect and is not associated with other diseases. They can also be a part of various genetic and chromosomal syndromes such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, Marfan syndrome, trisomy 13 and Noonan syndrome.
Congenital heart disease can be cyanotic (Figure 60) or noncyanotic (Figure 61) depending on whether the defect in

the heart causes mixing of blood from the right and left sides of the heart. Non-cyanotic congenital heart diseases include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, coarctation of the aorta and atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect).
Symptoms depend on the specific defect. While cyanotic congenital heart disease such as Fallots tetrology (Figure 60) features are present at birth, some other defects may not be immediately obvious. Defects such as coarctation of the aorta may not cause problems for many years. People with small ventricular septal defects may have no symptoms and can have a normal lifespan. Many congenital heart defects are amenable to cost-effective surgery that can be life saving and improve long-term prognosis.
A portfolio of prevention approaches are available for prevention of congenital heart disease and other birth defects (117). Most birth defects of environmental origin can be prevented by public health approaches, including prevention of sexually transmitted infections, legislation controlling management of toxic chemicals (e.g. certain agricultural chemicals), vaccination against rubella and fortification of basic foods with micronutrients (iodine and folic acid). Policies to optimize women’s diet before and throughout pregnancy are critical for prevention of birth defects, including congenital heart and nervous system defects (117, 118).

Rheumatic heart disease: A neglected heart disease of the poor

Key messages
■■ At least 15.6 million people are estimated to be currently affected by rheumatic heart disease.
■■ Rheumatic heart disease disproportionately impacts children and young adults living in low-income countries.
■■ Poverty alleviation and better living conditions are key for prevention of rheumatic heart disease.
■■ Progressive damage of heart valves in children who have had rheumatic fever can be prevented by administering long-term penicillin prophylaxis.

Rheumatic fever is a common cause of acquired heart disease in children and adolescents living in poor socioeconomic conditions. Acute rheumatic fever follows untreated or inadequately treated group A streptococcal infection of the tonsillopharynx and manifests after a latent period of about three weeks. Acute rheumatic fever primarily affects the heart, joints and central nervous system. The major importance of acute rheumatic fever is its ability to cause fibrosis of heart valves (Figure 62), leading to crippling haemodynamics of valvular heart disease, heart failure and death. Surgery is often required to repair or replace heart valves in patients with severely damaged valves, the cost of which is very high and a drain on the limited health resources of poor countries.
Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease continue to exert a significant burden on the health of low socioeconomic populations in LMICs despite the near disappearance of the disease in the developed world over the past century (119). The decline of rheumatic fever in developed countries is believed to be the result of improved living conditions and availability of antibiotics for treatment of group A streptococcal infection. Overcrowding, poor housing conditions, undernutrition and lack of access to health care play a role in the persistence of this disease in developing countries.

The global burden of disease caused by rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease currently falls disproportionately on children and young adults living in low-income countries and is responsible for about 233 000 deaths annually (Figures 63–66). At least 15.6 million people are estimated to be currently affected by rheumatic heart disease with a significant number of them requiring repeated hospitalization and often unaffordable heart surgery in the next 5 to 20 years (120–122).
Primary prevention is achieved by treatment of acute throat infections caused by group A streptococcus. This effect may be achieved at relatively low cost if a single intramuscular penicillin injection is administered (123). Secondary prevention is used following an attack of acute rheumatic fever to prevent the progression to cardiac disease and has to be continued for many years. Secondary prevention programmes are currently thought to be more cost effective for prevention of rheumatic heart disease than primary prevention and may be the only feasible option for LMICs (119) in addition to poverty alleviation efforts.

Chagas disease

Key messages
■■ Chagas disease is a neglected disease of the poor that has a high potential for elimination through alleviation of poverty and improvement of living conditions.
■■ An estimated 10 million people are infected with Chagas disease worldwide.

(American trypanosomiasis):

A neglected disease of the

poor

Chagas disease is a chronic, systemic, parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. It is mainly transmitted by the infected faeces of triatomine bugs (also known as “kissing bugs”), which live in the cracks in the walls of poorly constructed homes in rural or suburban areas. The illness can also be transmitted by blood transfusions or organ transplants from infected donors or from an infected mother to her newborn during pregnancy or childbirth (124–128).
Chagas disease has two phases: the initial acute phase of infection lasts from four to eight weeks; and the chronic phase persists for the lifespan of the host. The acute phase may be asymptomatic; when symptoms occur, they include: malaise; fever; hepatomegaly; splenomegaly; lymphadenopathy; subcutaneous oedema (localized or generalized); signs of portal of entry of Trypanosoma cruzi through a skin lesion (chagoma); or purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (Romaña sign) (Figure 67). During the chronic phase, up to 30% of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 10% suffer from digestive problems (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon) and neurological involvement. Chagas disease can lead to sudden death or heart failure caused by progressive destruction of the heart muscle (124–126).

An estimated 10 million people are infected worldwide, mostly in Latin America where Chagas disease is endemic (Figure 68). More than 25 million people are at risk of the disease. It is estimated that in 2008 Chagas disease killed more than 10 000 people (124). In the past several decades, it has been increasingly detected in Canada, the United States and European and Western Pacific countries mainly due to migration of infected people from endemic countries (127).
Key components of prevention and control initiative of Chagas Disease include vector control, prevention of transmission from non-vectorial mechanisms, improved housing, health education, epidemiological surveillance, serological screening and drug treatment. Such initiatives have achieved a substantial decrease in the burden of Chagas disease. However, to maintain the achieved results and further decrease the burden, surveillance and control activities, including vector control, serological screening, supervised treatment and new antiparasitic drugs, are needed at international, regional and national levels in the future (127–129).

Key messages
■■ The decline in cardiovascular mortality seen in many developed countries over the last two decades has been attributed to reduced incidence rates and/or improved survival after cardiovascular events due to a combination of prevention and treatment interventions.
■■ To reverse CVD trends, a significant increase in the investment in prevention strategies is required.

Over the last two decades, cardiovascular mortality rates have declined in many high-income countries (13, 14, 130, 131). A combination of population-wide primary prevention and individual health-care intervention strategies have contributed to these declining mortality trends (4–6, 13, 14). Figure 69 shows the declining trends in CVD mortality rates in some developed countries. This decline in mortality has been attributed to reduced incidence rates and/or improved survival after cardiovascular events due to health care interventions (13).
The North Karelia project in Finland began in 1972. A comprehensive community intervention was designed and implemented to achieve population-wide changes in dietary habits to shift the population distribution of cardiovascular risk factors. By 1995, the project reported an impressive 73% reduction in age-adjusted coronary heart disease mortality rate (Figure 70.1). The framework for the project incorporated behaviour change and communication and community organization principles; and the intervention itself included media campaigns, partnership with the food industry, involvement of local health-care and community organizations, agricultural reforms and providing health care for those at high cardiovascular risk among other components (15).
The cardiovascular mortality rate in right-bank Warsaw inhabitants in Poland declined between 1991 and 2002 by

over 50% (132, 133). It is thought that changes in dietary patterns explain, at least in part, this marked reduction in cardiovascular mortality observed in Poland. During this period, a decrease in the consumption of butter by 52%, other animal fats by 20%, milk by 27%, beef by 57% and potatoes by 8% was noted. On the other hand, the consumption of vegetable fat increased by 100%, poultry by 70% and fruit by 64%. A decrease of 19% in the consumption of saturated fatty acids and an increase of 32% in the intake of the polyunsaturated fatty acids were reported (13, 133).
Coronary heart disease mortality in the United Kingdom has also declined sharply between 1981 and 2000 (14) (Figure 70.2). About 42% of this decrease has been attributed to treatment and the rest to population-wide risk factor reductions.
Population wide strategies for tobacco and alcohol control and salt reduction in diet are very cost effective. They are affordable even for low and middle income countries. Some individual interventions are also cost effective, affordable and scalable in LMIC. Multidrug therapy in primary care for people at high risk of developing heart attacks and strokes and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction (heart attacks) are two such interventions which are further elaborated in chapter 33.

control of CVDs:

The need for integrated and

complimentary strategies

In all populations, it is essential that individual health care targeting people at raised cardiovascular risk and people with disease is complemented by population-wide public health strategies (Figure 31) (4, 6). Although cardiovascular events are less likely to occur in people with low levels of risk, no level of risk can be considered “safe”. Without population-wide public health prevention efforts, cardiovascular events will continue to occur in people with low and moderate levels of risk, and who are the majority in any population. Furthermore, public health approaches can effectively slow down the development of atherosclerosis (and also reduce the incidence of some cancers and chronic respiratory diseases) in young people, thereby reducing the likelihood of future epidemics of cardiovascular events such as were seen in the period 1960–1990 in most high-income countries. Population-wide strategies would also support lifestyle modification in those at high risk. The extent to which one strategy is emphasized over the other depends on achievable effectiveness, cost effectiveness and resource considerations. Prevention and control of strokes and heart attacks require integrated strategies because they share common risk factors and a common pathogenesis (atherosclerosis) (134–136).
The appropriate threshold of an individual’s total risk at which intensive lifestyle interventions and drug treatment

are initiated depends on the availability of resources and the impact of specific interventions. The cost effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for high blood pressure and blood cholesterol depends on the total cardiovascular risk of the individual before treatment (4, 137–141); long-term drug treatment is justified only in high-risk individuals with a low risk–benefit ratio. If resources allow, the target population can be expanded to include those with moderate levels of risk; however, lowering the threshold for treatment will increase not only the benefits, but also the costs and potential harm. Everyone with low levels of risk will benefit from population-based public health strategies and, if resources allow, individual counselling to motivate behavioural change.
State-funded health systems have the difficult task of setting a risk threshold for treatment that balances the healthcare resources in the public sector, the wishes of clinicians and the expectations of the public. These decisions are particularly challenging when public expenditure for health is inadequate (Figures 71 and 72). As the threshold for intervention is lowered, the number of individuals eligible to benefit increases, but so do the costs and the number of adverse events caused by drug treatments (2, 4, 6).

Prevention and control of CVDs: Health in All Policies

Determinants of cardiovascular risk factors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) lie outside the health sector in many other domains, including finance, education, transport, agriculture, food, trade, environment and urban planning (4, 142, 143). Prevention and control of CVD require a coherent policy response across all these sectors. Ministries of health have the challenging task of providing leadership to navigate stakeholders in these multiple sectors who have differing interests by setting shared responsibilities for improvements in health that are linked to other development priorities.
Health in All Policies highlights the important links between health and broader economic and social goals in modern societies. It is a political choice and highly context specific. It requires strategies to support the required governance and implementation of integrated policies. Health in All Policies needs to be viewed as a shared goal across different government departments, and be used as an innovative approach to intersectoral action.
While implementation of policies across different sectors is essential to improve cardiovascular health, the health sector remains vital for progress. It has an important role in the governance required for intersectoral action, although it should not expect to lead all activities in other sectors. Instead, the health sector needs to construct a dialogue on

why health is a shared goal across society and identify how other sectors can benefit from action to protect health, in terms of their own priorities. The health sector also has an important role in working with other sectors to reduce differences in exposure and vulnerability to cardiovascular risk factors.
Despite new insights into the impact on health of poor housing, built-up environment, lack of education and unemployment, systems in all countries remain inadequate to coherently implement whole-of-government strategies working between different sectors to address these issues (68, 69, 144). As no single sector on its own can mount an effective response, new systems and governance are required to deliver a range of actions for protection of cardiovascular health. The lack of development of the necessary governance and systems to implement coherent policies across government has been a significant obstacle to progress. The response needs to consider the impact of intersectoral policies on health as well as the benefits of improvements in health for the goals of other sectors.

Prevention and control of CVDs: The need for a national NCD policy framework

Key messages
■■ Healthy public policies are essential for prevention and control of CVD.
■■ A national NCD policy enables governments to take coherent and sustained macrolevel action on intersectoral and health system issues that are key for prevention and control of all NCDs, including CVD.
■■ Multiple stakeholders need to be engaged in monitoring and evaluation of intersectoral action for prevention of CVD.

For prevention and control of CVD, unhealthy behaviours of people, including tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol, need to be modified. These behaviours are shaped by economic growth, globalization, urbanization, social determinants and corporate influences. Health literacy, individual efforts and health education by health professionals can play an important role in modifying these behaviours. However, changing the behaviour of people is difficult and cannot be accomplished by such efforts alone. An enabling policy environment is fundamental for modifying and sustaining healthy behaviour.
Environments conducive to healthy behaviours can be created if health is a key consideration of sector-wide public policies in domains that have an influence on health; such as transport, agriculture, education, finance, social services and trade. Only such a policy environment can provide people opportunities and affordable choices to change and maintain healthy behaviours in relation to diet, physical activity and tobacco and alcohol use. A national NCD policy can serve as a tool for coordinated action if relevant ministries outside health collaborate in the development process and have a co-responsibility in implementing multisectoral policy actions. Figure 73 shows WHO Member States reporting the presence of an NCD policy.
Most NCDs have long incubation periods and require longhaul policy actions to bring about change. The long incubation periods also provide windows of opportunity for control

of behavioural as well as metabolic risk factors of NCDs (e.g. obesity, raised blood sugar, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia) and thereby prevent complications of CVD (e.g. heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, renal disease). Health systems should catalyse, coordinate and coherently integrate policies across other relevant health sectors to create conducive environments that enable people to make and maintain healthy living choices (4, 6 ,68, 142–144). Such policies are integral to the promotion of tobacco and alcohol avoidance, healthy diet and regular physical activity for reducing risk factors in the whole population. Complimentary health-care policies need to target early detection and treatment of risk factors and diseases through a primary health care approach. One of the key objectives of a national NCD policy framework should be to reduce unfair social gradients related to NCDs and their risk factors (68, 69). In this respect, comparing the impact of all NCD policies on affluent and disadvantaged groups can help to identify areas of public policy that require greater attention in respect of social gradients.
Strategies and policies that support tobacco control, healthy nutrition, physical activity and prevention of the harmful use of alcohol play a key role in NCD prevention and control and require multi-stakeholder efforts (4, 6, 26, 29, 41, 43). Policy making and planning in all aspects of NCD prevention and control need to be inclusive and involve a broad range of relevant stakeholders including the civil society, nongovernmental organizations and the private sector.

Policies and strategies for tobacco control

Key messages
■■ Tobacco control interventions are best buys.
■■ Implementing specific tobacco demand reduction measures is possible in a short time.
■■ Accelerating progress in tobacco control requires leadership of national authorities, political commitment, efficient governance mechanisms and investment.

To counter the global threat of the growing tobacco epidemic, WHO Member States have negotiated the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which has been ratified by over 170 countries representing about 90% of the world's population (145–147). The reports from Parties indicate massive progress worldwide, with strong achievements by Parties and the Conference of Parties. Countries can take advantage of the significant progress in implementing the WHO FCTC and remarkable global momentum for tobacco control created by the treaty to further advance its implementation.
Preliminary new evidence indicates that total expenditure for implementation of tobacco control demand reduction strategies would range from US$ 0.10 to US$ 0.23/person/ year in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, and from US$ 0.11 to US$ 0.72/person/year in upper-middle-income countries. An important portion of this expenditure is attributed to educational media campaigns, while other measures come at a lower cost (e.g. increasing taxes, complete smoke-free indoor environments, health warnings, banning tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship) (6, 145, 148, 149).
Experiences in several countries show that implementing the demand reduction measures of the WHO FCTC can be accomplished in a short time and at very reasonable cost. Scaling up the implementation of the WHO FCTC is feasible and would bring immense health, social and economic benefits (25, 78, 150–157).

Many countries have successfully implemented the following articles of the WHO FCTC: ■■ Article 6: Increasing tobacco taxes and prices (Figure
74); ■■ Article 8: Creating completely smoke-free environ-
ments in indoor workplaces, public places and transportation; ■■ Articles 11 and 12: Warning the population about the dangers of tobacco; ■■ Article 13: Banning tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship; ■■ Article 5.2: Creating strong national tobacco control programmes as a mechanism to exert governmental leadership in tobacco control; ■■ Article 5.3: Protecting public health policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry.
More recently, the tobacco industry has been shifting its focus to LMICs, with a particular emphasis on marketing to the young and to women in these countries. This has resulted in an increase in tobacco use among the young (Figure 75) and in women. The size and reach of the tobacco industry activities alone can, if left unchecked, undo much of the health gains achieved by many LMICs in the last 20 or so years.

Policies and strategies to facilitate healthy eating

Key messages
■■ Reduction of saturated and transfatty acids, reduction of salt from industrially processed food, reduction of marketing of food and nonalcoholic beverages to children and improvement of availability of fruits and vegetables are interventions that can have a high impact in preventing CVDs.
■■ Accelerating progress in reducing diet-related NCDs/CVDs requires the leadership of national authorities, political commitment, efficient governance mechanisms and adequate investment.

In response to global nutrition challenges, the 63rd World Health Assembly requested WHO to develop a comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, young child and infant nutrition that would boost the implementation of food and nutrition policies and programmes worldwide (158). In addition, to counteract the extensive advertising and other forms of food marketing to children, the 63rd World Health Assembly endorsed a set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children (81). The document calls for national and international action to reduce the impact on children of marketing of foods high in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, free sugars or salt.
The maximum benefit of a life-course approach to improving nutrition would be achieved from interventions targeting early stages of life as well as actions towards older children and adolescents (80, 159–163). There is evidence that poor nutrition during pregnancy and early life increases the predisposition to NCDs later in life (72–74). Television advertising is associated with increased consumption of snacks and drinks high in sugar, consumption of nutrientpoor foods and increased caloric intake. Figures 76 and 77 show trans-fatty acids as a percentage of total fat in fast foods sold in selected countries. Improvement of infant and young child feeding and the reduction in marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages high in salt, fats and sugar to children are cost-effective actions to reduce CVDs and other NCDs. Figure 78 shows countries that have taken regulatory action to reduce trans-fats.

There is evidence to suggest that multipronged intervention strategies have the potential to achieve greater health gains than individual interventions, and often with greater cost effectiveness. Additionally, a combination of national and local-level actions in different sectors is beneficial to the implementation of food and nutrition policies. They include maternity protection at work, improvement of family and community practices, improving skills in health workers, communication and information strategies, product labelling to help consumers make the right food choices and improving school food in combination with educational activities and interventions in workplace settings (3, 25, 80, 151–163).
Figure 79 shows the salt consumption per capita and salt consumption surplus in selected countries. WHO has set a global target for maximum intake of salt for adults at 5 grams/day (i.e. 2000 mg/day of sodium) or lower if specified by national targets (43, 49, 50, 159). High-income countries are taking steps to reduce population salt intake by reducing salt in processed food (45). In rural areas in LMICs, where most of the salt consumed comes from salt added during cooking or from sauces and additives, a public education campaign is needed to encourage people to use less salt. In urban areas in LMICs, there is increasing consumption of processed and prepared food. In these areas, a combination of measures, including a food industry response to reduce the amount of salt added to food, food labelling and consumer education, will be required to reduce the population intake of sodium.

Key messages

facilitate physical activity

Physical activity can play a significant role in the prevention and control of CVD and in addressing overweight and obesity (Figures 80–82). There are many gaps and challenges encountered in improving physical activity levels, and intersectoral action is required to address them. Areas for action on physical activity promotion include: (i) schoolbased programmes; (ii) transport policies that prioritize walking and cycling; (iii) urban design; (iv) primary health care; (v) public awareness and mass media; (vi) community-wide programmes; and (vii) sports system/programmes. An effective approach requires the implementation of multiple concurrent strategies, therefore, the participation of the sectors and leaders corresponding to each of these areas of action is critical. In many countries, the first step has been to engage these key sectors to raise their awareness about how their policies and actions are affecting health.
Adequate levels of physical activity, including moderate intensity physical activity such as everyday walking and cycling as a means of transportation, can best be achieved through an enabling environment. Thus, increasing physical activity is a societal and not just an individual undertaking. As such, it demands a population-based, multisectoral, multidisciplinary and culturally relevant approach (163,164).
In urban settings, the changing environment is reducing opportunities for physical activity. City dwellers are also

likely to have sedentary occupations, to use motorized means of transportation and be less likely to engage in physical activity during their leisure and recreation time.
The WHO Global NCD Action Plan (2008) urges Member States to promote physical activity through the implementation of school-based interventions and the provision of physical environments that support safe active commuting, safe transport and the creation of space for recreational activity (3).
All the evidence on changing physical activity habits shows that creating an enabling environment, providing appropriate information and ensuring wide accessibility are critical to influencing behaviour change, regardless of the setting.

Policies and strategies to address the harmful use of alcohol

Key messages
■■ Addressing the harmful use of alcohol is one of the key components of NCD/ CVD prevention and control.
■■ There are cost-effective interventions with good return (best buys) for addressing the harmful use of alcohol.
■■ Best buys include increasing alcoholic beverage excise taxes, restricting access to alcoholic beverages and comprehensive restrictions and bans on advertising and promotion of alcoholic beverages.

The Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2010 and the WHA resolutions WHA61.4, WHA63.13 (79) and WHA58.26 (165) as well as the regional and subregional strategies and action plans provide the necessary policy and implementation frameworks for reducing the harmful use of alcohol. The reduction of alcohol-related harm entails a range of effective measures implemented at all levels, including population-based measures and adequate health services responses such as early identification of people at risk and subsequent interventions (166–169). Figures 83 and 84 show the prevalence of alcohol consumption of students (13–15 years) from selected countries. Special attention needs to be paid for preventing alcohol consumption in children.
The following strategies and interventions have the highest level of effectiveness to prevent the harmful use of alcohol: ■■ increasing excise taxes on alcoholic beverages; ■■ regulating physical availability of alcoholic beverages,
including minimum legal purchase age, restrictions on outlet density and time and place of sales, public health oriented licensing systems and governmental monopolies of retail sales; ■■ drink-driving countermeasures such as lowered blood alcohol concentration limits and “zero tolerance” for young drivers, random breath testing and sobriety check points;

■■ legal-based comprehensive restrictions on bans on advertising and promotion of alcoholic beverages;
■■ treatment of alcohol use disorders and brief interventions for hazardous and harmful drinking.
The challenge to the implementation of these effective strategies is to ensure mobilization of political will and the necessary resources for sustainable multisectoral action to guarantee the necessary resources and establish appropriate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.
The French alcohol and tobacco policy law – La Loi Évin (formally Loi n°91–32 du 10 janvier 1991 relative à la lutte contre le tabagisme etl'alcoolisme) – provides examples of restrictions on alcohol advertising and marketing (170). This policy bans the advertising of all alcoholic beverages containing over 1.2% alcohol by volume on television or in cinemas, and prohibits sponsorship of sports or cultural events by alcohol companies. La Loi Évin also prohibits the targeting of young people and controls the content of alcohol advertisements. Messages and images must refer only to the characteristics of the products and a health warning must be included in each advertisement. In 2008, this legislation was extended to apply to alcohol advertising on the Internet and in newspaper and magazine editorials. Alcohol advertising is only permitted in the press for adults, on billboards, on radio channels (under certain conditions) and at some special events or places. There are significant monetary sanctions for infringements of the law, which have ensured its implementation.
