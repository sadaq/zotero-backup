Morning blood pressure surge is associated with serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity in essential hypertensive patients
R Elsurer1 and B Afsar2
The phenomenon that blood pressure rises sharply in the morning is called ‘Morning Blood Pressure Surge’ (MBPS). Serum gammaglutamyltransferase (GGT) is a proinﬂammatory marker involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Although both are novel cardiovascular risk factors associated with inﬂammation and atherosclerosis, the speciﬁc relationship between MBPS and serum GGT is unknown. This study investigates the relationship between MBPS and serum GGT activity in essential hypertensive patients. Totally, 320 hypertensive patients were recruited. Mean MBPS was 17.0 ± 12.9 mm Hg. MBPS was positively correlated with age (r = +0.222, P o0.0001), body mass index (r = +0.132, P = 0.018), GGT (r = +0.271, P o0.0001), daytime augmentation index adjusted for heart rate (AIx@75) (r = +0.140, P = 0.014), 24-h pulse wave velocity (PWV) (r = +0.143, P = 0.014) and daytime PWV (r = +0.158, P = 0.007). From the 25th to 75th quartile of serum GGT, MBPS increased signiﬁcantly (Ptrend o 0.0001). In multivariate linear regression analysis, MBPS was independently associated with age (P = 0.002), dipping status (P o 0.0001) and logGGT (P o 0.0001). In conclusion, MBPS is independently associated serum GGT activity in essential hypertensive patients. This is the ﬁrst study in the literature to demonstrate an independent and a dose–response relationship between the two novel cardiovascular risk factors, MBPS and serum GGT, in this patient population.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of hypertension as a risk factor of target organ
damage and cardiovascular disease is widely acknowledged.
Although clinic blood pressure (BP) is used as the primary tool for
the diagnosis and management of hypertension, out of clinic BP
measurements, by the use of ambulatory BP monitoring, is
considered more reliable than clinic BP measurements because they are more reproducible.1
BP exhibits a diurnal variation, reaching the highest level in the
morning and then declining to reach a trough level at night. The
phenomenon that BP rises sharply in the morning is called ‘Morning Blood Pressure Surge’ (MBPS). MBPS has been reported to occur in response to sudden activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased α-mediated sympathetic activity,2 and can be measured reliably using ambulatory BP monitoring. MBPS is considered to be a cardiovascular risk factor.1 The study by Kario et al.3 was the ﬁrst to show that an excessive MPBS was a predictor of subsequent stroke in elderly hypertensive patients,
independent of ambulatory BP levels and target organ damage.
Subsequently, in the Ohasama study, an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage was observed in subjects with a large MBPS (⩾25 mm Hg).4 Recently, Li et al.5 reported that MBPS exceeding the 90th percentile was a signiﬁcant and independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events.
Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), a plasma membrane-
bound enzyme, has been used as a biological marker for alcohol intake or liver cell damage.6 GGT has a pro-oxidative effect, as it is
involved in the degradation of the antioxidant glutathione, and
has an indirect pro-oxidative effect by causing low-density

lipoprotein cholesterol oxidation in the presence of iron. GGT is also considered as a proinﬂammatory marker, and serum GGT activity found within atherosclerotic lesions directly contributes to atherosclerosis progression.7 Studies have shown that serum GGT might have a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke and metabolic syndrome.6,7 Shankar et al.8 reported that higher serum GGT levels were positively associated with prehypertension in US adults free of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Stranges et al.9 showed that serum GGT, within the physiological range, was a strong predictor of incident hypertension in a dose–response relationship. Kawamoto et al.10 reported that both systolic and diastolic BPs increased signiﬁcantly with increasing GGT levels among communitydwelling men in Japan. Most recently, Chun et al.6 and Kim et al.7 disclosed that serum GGT was independently associated with incident prehypertension and hypertension in Korean adults, respectively.
In this study, we investigated whether MBPS, which is a cardiovascular risk factor, is associated with serum GGT in patients with essential hypertension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS The study had a single-center, cross-sectional design. Totally, 320 consecutive patients from outpatient clinics with essential hypertension who agreed to participate in this study were recruited. The study protocol complied with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000, and was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. All participants gave informed consent. The exclusion criteria were the presence of secondary

332 hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, inﬂammatory diseases (acute infection, autoimmune diseases), malignancy, sleep apnea, positive HBsAg and/or positive anti-HCV antibody tests and shift working. None of the patients had alcohol abuse. Patients with known coronary artery disease, who were free from acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary revascularization procedure within the last 3 months, were included. All patients underwent the following procedures; anamnesis, physical examination, routine biochemical testing, ofﬁce and ambulatory BP monitoring and calculation of sleepthrough MBPS. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as (weight (kg))/(height (m))2. Hypertension was deﬁned as systolic BP (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or more, diastolic BP (DBP) of 90 mm Hg or more or both. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus was based on the American Diabetes Association criteria.11 Coronary artery disease was deﬁned as a history of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or coronary revascularization procedure (coronary stent replacement and coronary artery by-pass graft surgery). Cerebrovascular disease was deﬁned as a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack or carotid revascularization procedure. Peripheral arterial disease was deﬁned as a history of intermittent claudication, ischemic leg ulcer, peripheral revascularization or amputation for critical limb ischemia. Level of kidney function was assessed by estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) calculated by Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease formula,12 as follows; eGFR (ml min− 1 per 1.73 m2) = 186 × serum creatinine (mg dl − 1) − 1.154 × age (years) − 0.203 × (1.210 if African-American) × (0.742 if female).
Ofﬁce BP measurement Ofﬁce BP measurements were recorded by Omron MZ model (Omron Health Care, Mukou City, Kyoto, Japan) sphygmomanometer. BPs were measured according to European Society of Hypertension Guidelines.13
Ambulatory BP measurement
Ambulatory BP measurement was performed by the validated Mobil-OGraph Arteriograph (I.E.M. GmbH, Stolberg, Germany) device based on the method described in elsewhere.14 All patients were instructed to rest or sleep between 2200 and 0700 hours (nighttime) and to continue their usual activities between 0700 and 2200 hours (daytime). By using Mobil-OGraph arteriograph device with an ARC solver method (Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna), pulse wave forms from brachial artery were recorded during 24 h. This new BP monitor oscillometrically captures pulse wave form from brachial artery by an upper-arm cuff and measures pulse wave velocity (PWV). Within a single measurement cycle, cuff pressure is hold for a time period of 10 s at diastolic value during cuff deﬂation. Recording time of oscillometric signal at diastolic level allows derivation of augmentation index adjusted for heart rate (AIx@75). Measurements were automatically calculated during 24-h, daytime and nighttime.14,15
Morning BP was deﬁned as the average of BPs during the ﬁrst 2 h after wake-up time (four BP readings). The lowest BP was deﬁned as the average BP of three readings centered on the lowest nighttime reading (that is, the lowest reading plus the readings immediately before and after). The sleepthrough MBPS was calculated as the morning SBP minus the lowest SBP.3
Biochemical analysis
Blood samples were obtained after participants had fasted overnight. Complete blood counts were made by using automated blood counting device. Serum uric acid was determined by enzymatic method. Other biochemical parameters were measured by standard methods.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normality of data was evaluated by Kolmogorov– Smirnov test (Lilliefors modiﬁcation). Data are shown as mean ± s.d. for normally distributed continuous variables, median (range) for nonnormally distributed continuous variables, and as a percentage (%), where appropriate. Spearman nonparametric correlation analysis was run between the MBPS and the clinical, laboratory and ambulatory BP parameters and eGFR. Kendall’s Tau correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between MBPS and the dipping status. Scatterplot graphic between MBPS and logGGT was run with Pearson correlation analysis. Comparison of the MBPS among GGT quartiles was carried out by

one-way analysis of variance test. For the posthoc comparison, Tukey test was used. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed with stepwise method to determine the possible factors (including age, gender, BMI, smoking, 24-h SBP, 24-h DBP, dipping status, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, use of acetylsalicylic acid, statin and antihypertensive drugs, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, logGGT and logeGFR as variables) independently related to MBPS. Because GGT and eGFR were not normally distributed, logarithmic conversion was performed before linear regression analysis. Results were considered statistically signiﬁcant if twotailed P is less than 0.05.
RESULTS Totally, 320 hypertensive patients (male/female: 133/187) were included. Table 1 demonstrates the basal demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. Overall, 79.7% of the patients were nondippers. The laboratory characteristics and eGFR of the study population are shown in Table 2.

The median eGFR was 80.8 ml min − 1 per 1.73 m2. Table 3 demonstrates the ofﬁce and ambulatory BP parameters, PWV and AIx@75 of the study population. The mean MBPS was
17.0 ± 12.9 mm Hg. The correlation analysis revealed that MBPS was positively
correlated with age (r: +0.222, P o0.0001), BMI (r: +0.132, P: 0.018), GGT (r: +0.271, P o 0.0001), daytime AIx@75 (r: +0.140, P: 0.014), 24-hour PWV (r: +0.143, P: 0.014) and daytime PWV (r: +0.158, P: 0.007). The MBPS was positively correlated with logGGT (r: +0.293, P o 0.0001) (Figure 1). In Kendall’s Tau correlation analysis, MBPS was correlated with the dipping status (r: − 0.216, P o0.0001). The other parameters were not correlated with MBPS (Table 4). From the 25th to 75th quartile of serum GGT, MBPS increased signiﬁcantly (Ptrend o 0.0001) (Figure 2). Post hoc analysis showed that MBPS was signiﬁcantly different between o 25th and 475th quartiles (P o 0.0001), 25th-50th and 475th quartiles (P: 0.001) and 50th–75th and 475th quartiles (P: 0.048).
Multivariate linear regression analysis for factors that might be
associated with MBPS (the model included age, gender, BMI,
smoking, 24-h SBP, 24-h DBP, dipping status, diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease, use of acetylsalicylic acid, statin and
antihypertensive drugs, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase,
logGGT and logeGFR as independent variables) demonstrated
that MBPS was independently associated with age (P: 0.023), dipping status (P o 0.0001) and logGGT (P o 0.0001) (Table 5).

GGT, MBPS increased signiﬁcantly. In adjusted analysis, MBPS was
independently associated only with age, dipping status and logGGT. This is the ﬁrst study in the literature to demonstrate an
independent association between MBPS and serum GGT, which is a proinﬂammatory marker, in patients with essential hypertension.
BP ﬂuctuates in a daily pattern of peaks and troughs known as the ‘Circadian Rhythm’.16 In the early morning, an abrupt and
steep acceleration in BP occurs, coincident with arousal and rising
from overnight sleep. A slow but steady increase in BP is then observed over the early morning hours.17 This is known as the ‘Morning Blood Pressure Surge’, and is thought to result from
increased physical activity and endogenous factors, such as sympathetic nervous system and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system activities, and endothelial function.16–18 Nitric oxide
production rises during morning hours in normotensives, a rise
that can be disrupted in patients with hypertension, further potentiating vasoconstriction.17 MBPS, which is determined by a
sum of physiologic and unphysiologic factors, is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.19 MBPS contributes to target organ damage 2 and is positively correlated with left ventricular mass and increased carotid intima–media thickness.20 The landmark study by Kario et al.3 showed an association between the MBPS
and cardiovascular risk. The authors reported that the top MBPS
decile had a threefold greater risk of multiple infarcts or stroke
after adjustment for 24-h BP and dipping status. Lee et al.21 reported that in never-treated essential hypertensive
patients, with no other cardiovascular risk factors, age was an independent risk factor for MBPS.21 Neutel et al.16 found that
increasing age was associated with a higher SBP MBPS. However,

in the multivariate analysis, age was not signiﬁcantly associated with MBPS and the authors suggested that the age effect is fully
accounted for by changes in other variables, such as BP variability in elderly patients. On the other hand, Sun et al.22 reported that in hypertensive individuals, MBPS was correlated with age. Similarly,
we found that MBPS was positively correlated with age in hypertensive individuals, and the association remained signiﬁcant even after adjusting for potential confounders.
Lee et al.21 disclosed a weak and not statistically signiﬁcant association between MBPS and BMI in never-treated hypertensive patients. In the study by Neutel et al.,16 MBPS was not affected by BMI in hypertensive patients. In the present study, although we
showed a positive correlation between MBPS and BMI, the association lost signiﬁcance in adjusted analysis.
Cross-sectional studies have indicated that MBPS is associated
with vascular remodeling such as atherosclerosis, arterial stiffening and small vessel disease. Inﬂammation also has an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Studies have reported that inﬂammatory status is associated with MBPS and MBPS-related atherosclerotic lesions.23 GGT is an enzyme expressed in serum and
most cell surfaces. Emerging evidence has shown that serum GGT
might be an important enzyme in the pathogenesis of cardiovas-
cular diseases and GGT has been suggested as a novel biomarker of cardiovascular risk.6,24 The role of GGT in cardiovascular disease is
partly explained by its correlation with conventional cardiovascular
risk factors such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
and metabolic syndrome, irrespective of alcohol consumption.
However, the exact mechanism linking GGT and cardiovascular disease is still unclear.25 GGT has a direct role in the generation of
reactive oxygen species in the presence of iron or other transition
metals, including lipid peroxidation in human biological membranes
and is an indirect marker of antioxidant systems, with the primary
function of maintaining the intracellular concentration of glutathione in response to oxidative stress.10 GGT has also been used as a proinﬂammatory marker because of its indirect involvement in the generation of cysteinyl-glycine, which results in low-density
lipoprotein oxidation. The enzyme activity of serum GGT found
within atherosclerotic lesions directly contributes to atherosclerosis progression.7 The current evidence suggests that MBPS and serum
GGT are the two novel cardiovascular risk factors associated with inﬂammation and atherosclerosis. However, the speciﬁc relationship between MBPS and serum GGT activity is a matter of interest.
Recent studies disclosed that serum GGT activity is related with BP changes. Chun et al.6 reported that serum GGT was positively associated with the incident prehypertension in healthy Korean men. Karakurt et al.26 found that serum GGT level was higher in patients with prehypertension group than in the control group in Turkish men and women. Stranges et al.9 showed that serum GGT was a signiﬁcant predictor of incident hypertension among overweight persons with increased central fat distribution. Kotani et al.27 disclosed that the degree of increase in SBP (and DBP only in non-diabetic subjects) was signiﬁcantly, independently and positively correlated to that of GGT in both diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. In this study, we speciﬁcally investigated the relationship between MBPS and serum GGT in patients with essential hypertension. We ﬁrstly demonstrated that MBPS was positively correlated with serum GGT (in a dose–response relationship), which remained signiﬁcant in adjusted analysis along with age and dipping status. The mechanisms underlying
the relationship between serum GGT and BP changes are not fully
understood. First, serum GGT has been interpreted as a reliable
marker of oxidative stress, which increases BP by direct
vasoconstriction and sodium retention in the vascular smooth
muscle and endothelial cells. Second, insulin resistance could have
a role in the association between serum GGT and BP changes,
because GGT might be interpreted as a marker for hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance.6 Nonetheless, this issue
warrants further prospective and interventional studies.

Increasing arterial stiffness is closely associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.28 Because pulse wave travels faster in arteries with decreased elasticity, arterial stiffness could be measured by PWV.2 Augmentation index (AIx) is a composite index that integrates the amount of wave that is reﬂected back to aorta and the velocity of incident and reﬂected wave.29 Aortic PWV and AIx are indices of arterial stiffness and are predictors for cardiovascular diseases.30 There is a paucity of studies investigating the relationship between arterial stiffness and MBPS. Suh et al.2 studied the association of MBPS with PWV in healthy Korean women. They showed that although arterial stiffness did not show signiﬁcant association with MBPS, it was associated with higher morning BP. However, their participants were nonhypertensive and they used maximum morning BPpower for evaluation of MBPS. Contrarily, Polonia et al.31 reported that MBPS was correlated signiﬁcantly with PWV. In our study, we showed that MBPS was positively correlated with daytime AIx@75, 24-h PWV and daytime PWV in hypertensive individuals.
This study has limitations that deserve mention. First, our study had a cross-sectional design, which precludes deriving a cause–effect relationship between MBPS and serum GGT activity. Second, although patients were instructed to rest or sleep between predeﬁned hours, the precise sleeping patterns of the patients are unknown. Third, we excluded patients with known viral hepatitis, but as we did not perform routine hepatic ultrasonography, we cannot completely rule out parenchymal liver diseases (fatty liver, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and so on). Fourth, different kidney function levels may inﬂuence the relationship between MBPS and GGT. However, in the current study, we had limited number of patients with loss of renal function; only 78 patients had eGFR ⩽ 60 ml min − 1 per 1.73 m2, which precluded us performing subgroup analysis according to stages of chronic kidney disease due to low statistical power. This issue merits further investigation. Lastly, as being hypertensive, our patients were on antihypertensive treatment and this may have been disadvantageous during MBPS assessment. Lastly, we relied on a single serum GGT measurement. However, on the other hand, our patient population is composed of patients with somewhat high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, our ﬁndings deserve critical attention.
In conclusion, MBPS is independently associated serum GGT activity in essential hypertensive patients. This is the ﬁrst study in the literature to demonstrate an independent and a dose–response relationship between the two novel cardiovascular risk factors, MBPS and serum GGT, in this patient population.
