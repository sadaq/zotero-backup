Abstract

Objectives:

Go to:

The objective of this study was to examine the associations of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels with the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components in Saudi adults.

Methods:

Go to:

The study comprised 400 participants (70 men and 330 women), aged between 40 and 88 years, randomly selected from the medicine clinics at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in a cross-sectional study design. A standardized questionnaire was used to determine demographics variables, general health, lifestyle habits, and medical history. Anthropometric and biochemical variables measurements were taken for all study participants. MetS was defined according to the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute report, by the presence of abdominal obesity.

Results:

Go to:

Higher means for triglycerides and insulin resistance indices (P < 0.0001) was found among those in the second, third, and fourth GGT quartiles as compared with their counterparts in the first quartile. McAuley index (β = −0.239, P < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval: −4.1–−1.5) was shown to be a major determinant of circulating GGT in a multivariate analysis.

Conclusion:

Go to:

Elevated serum GGT could be a cardiometabolic risk factor either as a mediator of low-grade systemic inflammation and as a mediator of oxidative stress through mediation of extracellular glutathione transport into cells of organ systems.
