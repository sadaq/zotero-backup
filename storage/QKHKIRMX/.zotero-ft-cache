We performed a prospective study to assess whether the relationship of age with hypertension was stronger in men with high normal serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) than in those with lower GGT levels. The study population included 8170 healthy male workers in a steel manufacturing company who had undergone health examinations in both 1994 and 1998. The higher the baseline GGT level, the effect of age on the development of hypertension was stronger. The incidence of hypertension among those aged 25–34, 35–44 and 45–50 years was 0.9, 2.2, 3.8% in those with GGTo20 U/l; 1.0, 4.1, 12.5% in those with GGT between 20 and 39 U/l; and 1.9, 6.3, 17.2% in those with GGTX40 U/l,

respectively. All relationships persisted after adjusting for baseline values of body mass index, alcohol intake, smoking, exercise, family history of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and changes of body mass index during 4 years (P for interaction ¼ 0.03). Our data supported the hypothesis that the effect of age on the development of hypertension differed by baseline GGT level, although the underlying mechanism for this interaction is unclear.

Introduction
In our previous longitudinal studies,1,2 we reported a strong dose–response relationships between serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) at baseline and development of type II diabetes. Although GGT has been widely used as a marker of alcohol consumption or liver disease,3 neither alcohol nor hepatic dysfunction explained the observed relationships between GGT and diabetes. In addition, the typical relationships between age or obesity and type II diabetes were shown only among those with high normal GGT level at baseline.1,2
In the same cohorts,2,4 GGT was a modest risk factor for hypertension. Furthermore, a strong interaction was found between GGT and alcohol consumption on the development of hypertension.4 In this interaction, a positive association between

alcohol consumption and hypertension was observed only in those with high normal GGT level. Among subjects with low GGT level, no matter how much alcohol the subjects drank, the risk of hypertension in drinkers was similar to that of nondrinkers.
Although serum and cellular GGT may not have the same biological meanings, it is interesting to note experimental studies in which GGT at a cellular level plays an important role in antioxidant systems through the maintenance of intracellular levels of glutathione.5–7 Paradoxically, recent studies8–11 have shown that GGT is itself able to play a pro-oxidant role, particularly in the presence of iron.
Emerging evidence suggests that hypertension and type II diabetes share pathophysiological mechanisms, especially oxidative stress.12–15 So, by analogy with type II diabetes, the association between age and hypertension might also depend on GGT level. Therefore, we performed this prospective study with the hypothesis that the relationship between age and hypertension was modified by baseline GGT level.

Materials and methods

This study was based on the same cohort as our previous study of GGT and hypertension. 4 Study design, recruitment of participants, and methods have been described in detail elsewhere.4 Briefly, our study population was 8170 male workers at one steel company in Korea, who were between 25 and 50 years without hypertension (systolic BP (SBP)X140 mmHg, diastolic BP (DBP)X90 mmHg, and/or taking antihypertensive medication) at baseline and examined in both 1994 and 1998 (follow-up rate: 73.7%). No specific informed consent for this study was obtained. Data are analysed pursuant to the Korean health regulation pertaining to factories, which states that the factory physician has an obligation to analyse health examination data to educate workers.
SBP and DBP were recorded oscillometrically with an automatic device (TM-2650A; A&D Company, Japan) in the sitting position after the subjects rested on a chair for 5 min or longer. For employees with SBPX160 mmHg or X95 mmHg, BP were measured again with an ordinary sphygmomanometer by an experienced nurse after another 5 min of rest. Serum GGT concentrations were measured at 371C with an automatic analyzer (normal range 0–50 U/L, Hitachi 7170, Japan).
In this study, 169 men met the definition of hypertension was SBPX160 mmHg or DBPX95 mmHg or under antihypertensive medication. First, we examined the relationship between age (25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–50 years) and SBP or DBP changes within three GGT categories at baseline GGT (0–19, 20–39, X40 U/l) by an analysis of covariance. Next, the relationship between age and incidence of hypertension was examined within the each category of GGT. We performed logistic regression analyses including interaction terms for GGT (0–19, 20–39, X40 U/l) and age (25–34, 35–44, 45–50 years). Covariates were the baseline values of body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), cigarette smoking (pack years), alcohol consumption (g/week), exercise (frequency/week), family history of hypertension, either SBP (mmHg) or DBP (mmHg), and the changes in BMI during 4 years. The SAS statistical program, version 8.02, was used in all analyses, the P-values quoted are two-sided, and those values o0.05 are regarded as statistically significant.
Results
Relationships between age and changes in SBP or DBP varied by baseline GGT level. There were stronger dose–response relationships between age and changes in both SBP and DBP for baseline GGT level X40 U/l than for lower GGT levels (Figures 1 and 2) (P for multiplicative interaction, o0.01 for SBP; 0.04 for DBP). In addition, the associations of GGT with both SBP and DBP varied by age. There were positive associations between GGT and

changes in SBP or DBP among those with age X35, whereas there was no association among those with age o35.
The association of age with incidence of hypertension also varied by baseline GGT level. As baseline GGT level increased, the association between age and incidence of hypertension strengthened (P ¼ 0.03 for multiplicative interaction) (Figure 3). Using those aged o35 years and GGT o20 as a reference group, adjusted relative risks for those age o35, 35–44, and X45 years were 1.0, 2.7, 4.5 in those with GGT o20 U/l, 0.6, 3.0, 10.9 in those with GGT between 20 and 39 U/l, and 0.9, 3.9, 19.7 in those with GGTX40 U/l (Table 1). The interaction was similarly observed among nondrinkers, drinkers, and subjects with normal GGT (data not shown). On the other hand, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) did not show any relationship with age in the development of hypertension. For example, adjusted relative risks for those aged X45 years compared to those aged o35 years was 8.8 (unadjusted inci-

Neither exclusion of participants who had abnormal ALT or AST nor additional adjustment for ALT or AST attenuated the associations among incident hypertension, GGT, and age shown in Table 1 and Figure 3.
Discussion
In agreement with our hypothesis, this study found that the association of age with the risk of hypertension varied by baseline GGT level. Among those

with high normal GGT, the effect of age on the development of hypertension was much greater than among those with low GGT. Another way to view the findings of this study is that the effect of GGT on the development of hypertension differed by age. Among young subjects, there was no effect of GGT for the risk of hypertension, whereas among old subjects, GGT showed a strong association. However, other liver enzymes such as ALT or AST did not show a relationship with incident hypertension, suggesting that the association between GGT, age and hypertension is not mediated by liver damage. This finding is consistent with the findings shown in the relationship between age and type II diabetes,1 supporting the concept that underlying mechanisms of hypertension and type II diabetes

Alternatively, we are interested in the possibility that body iron storage plays a role in this interaction between GGT and age, because the cellular role of GGT differs depending on iron storage.8–11 In this study, among young subjects who probably had low body iron storage,18 GGT

The use of a single reading of BP in our study may have served as a drawback. A single reading is generally considered inadequate for determining the individual’s usual BP level because of large random fluctuations in casual readings.

In addition, because 42.6% of all hypertension cases (n ¼ 77) were taking antihypertensive medication at follow-up, use of such medication could lead to misclassification of changes in BP.
