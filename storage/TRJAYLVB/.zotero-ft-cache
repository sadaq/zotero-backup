ATP III Classification of LDL, Total, and HDL Cholesterol (mg/dL)

Total Cholesterol <200 200-239 >240

Step 2 Identify presence of clinical atherosclerotic disease that confers high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) events (CHD risk equivalent):

s Clinical CHD

s Symptomatic carotid artery disease

s Peripheral arterial disease

3

s Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Step 3 Determine presence of major risk factors (other than LDL):

Major Risk Factors (Exclusive of LDL Cholesterol) That Modify LDL Goals
Cigarette smoking Hypertension (BP >140/90 mmHg or on antihypertensive medication) Low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL)* Family history of premature CHD (CHD in male first degree relative <55 years; CHD in female first degree relative <65 years) Age (men >45 years; women >55 years)
* HDL cholesterol >60 mg/dL counts as a “negative” risk factor; its presence removes one risk factor from the total count.

s Note: in ATP III, diabetes is regarded as a CHD risk equivalent.

Step 4

If 2+ risk factors (other than LDL) are present without CHD or CHD risk equivalent, assess 10-year (short-term) CHD risk (see Framingham tables). Three levels of 10-year risk:

Step 5

s >20% — CHD risk equivalent s 10-20% s <10%
Determine risk category:

s Establish LDL goal of therapy s Determine need for therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) s Determine level for drug consideration

LDL Cholesterol Goals and Cutpoints for Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) and Drug Therapy in Different Risk Categories.

Risk Category
CHD or CHD Risk Equivalents (10-year risk >20%)

LDL Goal <100 mg/dL

LDL Level at Which to Initiate Therapeutic LDL Level at Which to Lifestyle Changes (TLC) Consider Drug Therapy

>100 mg/dL

>130 mg/dL (100-129 mg/dL: drug optional)*

2+ Risk Factors (10-year risk <20%)

<130 mg/dL

>130 mg/dL

10-year risk 10-20%: >130 mg/dL
10-year risk <10%: >160 mg/dL

0-1 Risk Factor†

<160 mg/dL

>160 mg/dL

>190 mg/dL (160-189 mg/dL: LDL-lowering drug optional)

* Some authorities recommend use of LDL-lowering drugs in this category if an LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL cannot be achieved by therapeutic lifestyle changes. Others prefer use of drugs that primarily modify triglycerides and HDL, e.g., nicotinic acid or fibrate. Clinical judgment also may call for deferring drug therapy in this subcategory.
† Almost all people with 0-1 risk factor have a 10-year risk <10%, thus 10-year risk assessment in people with 0-1 risk factor is not necessary.

6
Step 6 Initiate therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) if LDL is above goal.

TLC Features
s TLC Diet: — Saturated fat <7% of calories, cholesterol <200 mg/day — Consider increased viscous (soluble) fiber (10-25 g/day) and plant stanols/sterols (2g/day) as therapeutic options to enhance LDL lowering
s Weight management s Increased physical activity.

7
Step 7 Consider adding drug therapy if LDL exceeds levels shown in Step 5 table:

s Consider drug simultaneously with TLC for CHD and CHD equivalents s Consider adding drug to TLC after 3 months for other risk categories.

Step 8 Identify metabolic syndrome and treat, if present, after 3 months of TLC.

Clinical Identification of the Metabolic Syndrome – Any 3 of the Following:

Risk Factor
Abdominal obesity* Men Women

Defining Level
Waist circumference† >102 cm (>40 in) >88 cm (>35 in)

Triglycerides

>150 mg/dL

HDL cholesterol Men Women

<40 mg/dL <50 mg/dL

Blood pressure

>130/>85 mmHg

Fasting glucose

>110 mg/dL

* Overweight and obesity are associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. However, the presence of abdominal obesity is more highly correlated with the metabolic risk factors than is an elevated body mass index (BMI). Therefore, the simple measure of waist circumference is recommended to identify the body weight component of the metabolic syndrome.
† Some male patients can develop multiple metabolic risk factors when the waist circumference is only marginally increased, e.g., 94-102 cm (37-39 in). Such patients may have a strong genetic contribution to insulin resistance. They should benefit from changes in life habits, similarly to men with categorical increases in waist circumference.

Treatment of the metabolic syndrome
s Treat underlying causes (overweight/obesity and physical inactivity): – Intensify weight management – Increase physical activity.
s Treat lipid and non-lipid risk factors if they persist despite these lifestyle therapies: – Treat hypertension – Use aspirin for CHD patients to reduce prothrombotic state – Treat elevated triglycerides and/or low HDL (as shown in Step 9).

9
Step 9 Treat elevated triglycerides.

ATP III Classification of Serum Triglycerides (mg/dL)

<150 150-199 200-499 ≥500

Normal Borderline high High Very high

Treatment of elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL)
s Primary aim of therapy is to reach LDL goal s Intensify weight management s Increase physical activity s If triglycerides are >200 mg/dL after LDL goal is reached, set
secondary goal for non-HDL cholesterol (total – HDL) 30 mg/dL higher than LDL goal.

Comparison of LDL Cholesterol and Non-HDL Cholesterol Goals for Three Risk Categories

Risk Category

LDL Goal (mg/dL)

Non-HDL Goal (mg/dL)

CHD and CHD Risk Equivalent (10-year risk for CHD >20%)
Multiple (2+) Risk Factors and 10-year risk <20%
0-1 Risk Factor

<100 <130 <160

<130 <160 <190

If triglycerides 200-499 mg/dL after LDL goal is reached, consider adding drug if needed to reach non-HDL goal:
• intensify therapy with LDL-lowering drug, or • add nicotinic acid or fibrate to further lower VLDL.
If triglycerides >500 mg/dL, first lower triglycerides to prevent pancreatitis:
• very low-fat diet (<15% of calories from fat) • weight management and physical activity • fibrate or nicotinic acid • when triglycerides <500 mg/dL, turn to LDL-lowering therapy.

Treatment of low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL)
s First reach LDL goal, then: s Intensify weight management and increase physical activity s If triglycerides 200-499 mg/dL, achieve non-HDL goal s If triglycerides <200 mg/dL (isolated low HDL) in CHD or CHD equivalent
consider nicotinic acid or fibrate.
