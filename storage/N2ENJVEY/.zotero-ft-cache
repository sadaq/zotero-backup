Reliable statistics related to the prevalence, incidence and mortality of hypertension and stroke are not available from Asia. The data may be in national or institutional reports or journals published in the local language only. The mortality rate for stroke has been on the decline since the mid 1960s in the developed countries of Asia, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, with some improvement in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, some areas of China and Malaysia about 15 years later. In India, China, Phillippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Iran, Pakistan, Nepal, there has been a rapid increase in stroke mortality and prevalence of hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension according to new criteria (Ͼ140/90 mm Hg) varies between 15–35% in urban adult populations of Asia. In rural populations, the prevalence is two to three times lower than in urban subjects.

Hypertension and stroke occur at a relatively younger age in Asians and the risk of hypertension increases at lower levels of body mass index of 23–25 kg/m2. Overweight, sedentary behaviour, alcohol, higher social class, salt intake, diabetes mellitus and smoking are risk factors for hypertension in most of the countries of Asia. In Australia, New Zealand and Japan, lower social class is a risk factor for hypertension and stroke. Population-based long-term follow-up studies are urgently needed to demonstrate the association of risk factors with hypertension in Asia. However prevention programmes should be started based on cross-sectional surveys and case studies without waiting for the cohort studies. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 749–763

Introduction
In Bhagwatgita (5000 BC), it is mentioned that ‘the foods which are bitter, acid, salted and burnt give rise to pain, stress and diseases’. About 2000 years ago, Confucius taught his students in China, ‘The higher the quality of foods, the better, and never rely upon the delicacy of cooking.’ So, in the earliest medical classics in China, a dietary guideline based on experience was given as ‘cereals—the basic, fruits—the subsidiary, meat—the beneﬁcial, and vegetable—the supplementary.’ However, in Indian classics, fruits, vegetables, nuts, milk and ghee and cereals were advised for good health.
In the ancient treatise Sushrit Samhita (600 BC),1 blood pressure has been described as ‘Raktachapa’. Thus high blood pressure as a clinical problem was

known to the ancient physician. There is an old Sanskrit proverb that ‘there are six good ﬂavours of food of which salt is the greatest’ which may be the cause of hypertension. In China, the presence of hypertension was suggested by hardening of arteries due to excess of salt in 2700 BC. In the year 1913, Janeway reported2 that patients with high blood pressure tend to die prematurely. Weises and Ellis in 19303 recognised the widespread prevalence of hypertension and mentioned the lack of treatment. Hay4 in Britain, observed that high blood pressure is a common problem which is more serious when it develops between the ages of 40–50 years. In India, Chopra5 studied the prevalence of hypertension in 1942 and showed that mean blood pressure was lower in Indians compared to Europeans and the overall prevalence of hypertension was lower. Later in 1949, Vakil6 conducted a trial of an Indian herb, Ranwolﬁa serpentina in the treatment of hypertension. Reserpine was isolated from this and is still used in many countries, including India.

marked increase in the consumption of salt, fat and tobacco and an increase in sedentary behaviour (due to the common use of automobiles) in the last three decades of development in Asia. These developments and changes in diet and lifestyle were associated with a marked increase in the prevalence of hypertension (Ͼ160/95 mm Hg), from 2–3% in 1960 to 15–20% in 1990 in different Asian countries.

Burden of cardiovascular disease in Asia
It has been estimated that during the period of 1965– 1990, cardiovascular mortality fell by 50% in Australia and by 60% in Japan.30–32 The decline in stroke mortality has been more marked especially in Japan where there was a nonsigniﬁcant increase in coronary mortality in 1985 in some areas. The discordant trend of rising CVD mortality rates in India, China and other parts of Asia, however is in sharp contrast to the decline in the western rim of Asia. The emergence of the CVD epidemic in the developing nations of Asia during the past 2–3 decades has attracted least attention and poor public health response even within these countries.21,22 It is not widely realised that the developing Asian countries contribute a greater share to the global burden of CVD than the developed countries of the world (Table 3). It has been estimated that 5.3 million deaths attributable to CVD occurred in the developed countries in 1990, whereas the corresponding ﬁgure for the developing nations of Asia was 6.3 million.33 It is possible that the causespeciﬁc mortality ascertainment methods currently used in Asia call for cautious interpretations of these estimates.30–32,34 In a recent multinational assessment,34 stroke ranks as the second or third leading cause of death in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea

and Singapore. Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia are countries with moderate hospitalbased data on stroke. India is the only country among three-country assessment, to have some data on stroke prevalence.34
The conservative assumptions made by the experts suggest that the absolute burden of stroke mortality is indeed likely to be greater in developing Asia. China, Taiwan and Japan rank highest in terms of stroke mortality in the region. The mortality rates for cerebrovascular disease in these countries stand close to a hundred or higher per 100 000 population for men and women for all ages. In China,35 stroke is the leading cause of death, while in Taiwan it currently ranks second, next to cancer, after being the main cause of death for almost 20 years from 1963 to 1982.35 The major type of stroke in Taiwan is cerebral infarction while for Japan and China, it is cerebral haemorrhage.36,37 In Japan twice as many men (2.1) and women (2.6) die from stroke as from CAD. Chonghna et al38 found that the incidence of stroke is four times that of acute myocardial infarction in some areas of China. There are about 5 million surviving stroke patients and some 1.3 million new cases occur each year. However, in New Zealand and Australia, stroke to CAD mortality ratio was only 0.3 for men and 0.6 for women. In Japan, workers in agriculture, sales, transportation and service industries have higher rates of stroke than those in business.39
New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong have a low stroke mortality of between 50–100 per 100 000 population. Their stroke mortality rates for men in 1991/92 ranged from 39 per 100 000 population in Australia and 72 for Singapore and among women, the rates ranged from 34 per 100 000 population for Australia to 68 for Singapore.30,31,39
The trends of stroke mortality indicate that Japan has undergone the most substantial decline since 1970 for both men and women. The decline in Japan was 20.1% for men and 22% for women in the 1980s. Taiwan40 has also experienced a reduction in its stroke death rate, albeit less rapidly than Japan during about the same period. Its decrease was 17.5% for men and 18.5% for women between 1972 and 1983, as compared to 43.6% and 42.4% for men and women respectively for Japan between 1970–74 and 1980–84. The magnitude of the decline in stroke mortality in Australia and New Zealand was also very rapid. In China there is mild decline in stroke mortality in some areas but in Singapore, the decline is impressive.

Values are given as a percentage of world total mortality.

One of the most important causes of concern is the early age of CVD deaths, risk of hypertension and CAD in the developing Asian countries, particularly among south Asians41 compared with Japan, Australia and other developed countries. In 1990, the proportion of CVD deaths occurring below the age of 70 years was 26.5% in the developed countries compared with 46.7% in the developing countries. For example, in a large developing country like India, deaths below 70 years were 52.2%.22 It is possible that impaired fetal nutrition may have an inverse relation with CVD which may occur relatively early in life.42,43 Adverse intrauterine inﬂuences such as poor maternal nutrition lead to impaired fetal growth, resulting in low birth weight, short birth length and small head circumference.43 It is possible that poor nutrition in the fetus may be associated with molecular and physiological adaptations to facilitate survival. These adaptations may lead to disordered responses to environmental challenges as the child grows, due to interaction of genes and environment.22 Only a modest increase in dietary fat and salt intake with a sedentary behaviour results in central obesity, overweight, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia activation of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system and premature hypertension and CAD in early adult life in south Asians.
Prevalence of hypertension
The prevalence of hypertension in countries of Asia was as low as 2% in rural areas to 24% in urban areas.7 According to new criteria of the WHO-ISH23 subcommittee (Ͼ140/90 mm Hg), the prevalence appears to be 5–35% in different countries of Asia (Tables 4 and 5). The prevalence of hypertension and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures varied from one country to another country and from one community to another community in the same country depending upon the economic development and afﬂuence.7,14–24
In one meta-analysis, performed by Gupta, studies of trends in blood pressure levels and the prevalence of hypertension at various places in India were described.14 Identiﬁcation of studies was done by using computer search manual retrieval and personal records. To qualify, the study had to be population-based using well-deﬁned randomisation techniques, with a sufﬁciently large sample size and reported prevalence of hypertension using standard criteria. In the MEDLINE database search, key words

were hypertension, prevalence, epidemiology and human. A total of 51 articles were located, in which only 34 met the selection criteria. Most studies from India have used WHO criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension published in 1959. According to these criteria, hypertension is deﬁned as systolic BP у160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP у95 mm Hg, or the individual is on medical treatment for hypertension. More liberal criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension have been suggested by several investigators and initially applied to population data by the fourth US Joint National Committee (JNC-IV). According to this committee, hypertension was diagnosed when systolic blood pressure is 140 mm Hg or more and/or diastolic blood pressure is 90 mm Hg or more, or the subject is on treatment for hypertension. The ﬁfth US Joint National Committee for detection, evaluation and treatment of hypertension in adults (JNC-V), the British Hypertension Society and the WHO-International Society of Hypertension have also adopted these guidelines.4,23 However, only a few studies have used these guidelines in Asia.
Table 6 shows studies on the prevalence of hypertension in India performed since 1942. This table also shows population type (urban, rural or tribal), the age group studied, criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension, total sample, gender distribution of the sample and percentage prevalence of hypertension in both sexes. It is clear that both urban and rural areas in various parts of India were studied and the diagnostic criteria were initially different in various studies.14 The age distribution of the populations studied in almost similar. The blood pressure measurement was performed at a work site, dispensary or at home, using a standardised mercury sphygmomanometer, in a sitting position.
Studies published from 1958 which used WHO criteria for diagnosis of hypertension have shown a steadily increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension (Tables 4–6).5,15–18,44–74 Studies from the cities of Ludhiana,60 Bombay,55 Jaipur73 and Moradabad17 showed a prevalence of more than 10%. Statistical analysis of this trend in comparable surveys showed a signiﬁcant increase demonstrated by non-parametric analysis (Mantel–Haenzel ␹2 = 6.11 P Ͻ 0.01). The prevalence of hypertension by WHO/ISH criteria also showed a steep increase from 6.2% in 1959 to 25.6% in 1998 (Table 5). According to old WHO guidelines, the prevalence of hypertension in rural populations also showed an increase (Table 6). Shah in Mumbai49 reported a prevalence

prevalence of hypertension in the last few decades in India (Mantel–Haenzel ␹2 = 5.93, P Ͻ 0.01). There was also a substantial increase in mean blood press-
ures from the 1960s to 1998 (Table 7). Since hypertension is the major cause of CAD and
stroke, it is clear that one of the biggest challenges
facing public health authorities and medical practioners is the control of hypertension, both in individual patients and at the population level. It affects
50 million people. Americans contribute to more

than half a million strokes and 1.25 million coronary attacks per year in the United States alone. A few international studies have reported trends over time in the prevalence and control of hypertension. No such studies are available from developing Asian nations. The Framingham Heart Study75 has reported the prevalence of long-term sustained hypertension in a US cohort. In this study, cohorts of men and women aged 50–59 years were analysed in 1950, 1960 and 1970. The prevalence of established hypertension in men (Ͼ160/95) increased from 16.1% in 1950 to 17.8% in 1960 and 18.7% in 1970 but the trend was not signiﬁcant (Mantel– Haenzel test, P = 0.66). In women, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the prevalence of hypertension from 26.3% in 1950 to 21.9% in 1960 and 15.4% in 1970 (P Ͻ 0.00). The reduction in hypertension

prevalence has been ascribed to a reduction in mean body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of obesity. The Seven Country Study76 also reported time trends in the prevalence of hypertension and changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The Minnesota Heart Health Program reported that during the period 1981–1990, the prevalence of hypertension decreased by 1% every year in men and by 0.27% every year in women, with a decrease in mean systolic blood pressure. The Italian and Greek cohorts of the seven countries study showed that there was a decrease in systolic blood pressure while it increased in Yugoslavian cohorts. The prevalence of hypertension increased in Japanese cohorts and no change was seen in Dutch and Finnish cohorts. Our analysis of Indian studies shows an increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension as well as mean blood pressures (Tables 4–7).
The International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN)12 study, using WHO criteria showed that the prevalence of hypertension was more than 20% among six of 12 communities in various parts of Asia and Latin America. The WHO reported that hypertension is an important public health problem in developing countries and in adults aged 40–55 years, blood pressure levels were the highest among Indian men as compared to those of 20 other developing countries.7 In the INCLEN77 each centre (three in Thailand, two each in China, Chile and Brazil and one each in Philippines, Indonesia and Colombia) examined approximately 200 men aged 35–65 years, drawn at random from a population within their locality. Risk factors included in the study were BMI, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and smoking of tobacco. Education, occupation, and current income were grouped into ordinal categories of socioeconomic status according to standard protocol guidelines and comparisons were made between risk factor levels within each of these categories. For blood pressure and cigarette smoking, the associations with socioeconomic status tended to be negative, more in line with the direction of association seen in the developed world, whereas for BMI, there were a number of centres which showed positive associations in China or urban and rural Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines.77 However, the criteria of social class were not well deﬁned in this study.

showed that BMI was a mean 22.2 (s.d. 3.24) in the four Asian urban populations and 21.4 (s.d. 3.33) in the three Asian rural populations, which were lower than BMI (25.3 (3.7)) in the ﬁve Latin American populations. Despite the differences in mean BMI levels, statistically signiﬁcant positive relationships of a similar magnitude were seen between BMI and blood pressure levels in both Asia and Latin America. The similarities of the associations between BMI and blood pressure in the two groups suggest that efforts to reduce BMI in all populations is likely to be important in reducing the risk of hypertension even in populations with BMI which is considered normal.
The Five City Study10 was a cross-sectional survey among 3257 women, aged 25–64 years from the cities of Moradabad (n = 902), Trivandrum (n = 760), Calcutta (n = 410), Nagpur (n = 405), and Mumbai (n = 780) (Tables 8–12).

Borderline isolated systolic hypertension was also signiﬁcantly prevalent, although its overall prevalence was less than that in the Framingham data.79 The prevalence of deﬁnite isolated systolic hypertension was low, in contrast to studies from industrialised western populations in which deﬁnite isolated systolic hypertension is an important subtype of hypertension especially in the elderly.3,80 A lower prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension among Indians might be due to there being fewer elderly people in India on account of lower life expectancy of Indians (61.5 years) compared to western populations (Ͼ75 years). Bulpitt has termed this phenomenon an exhaustion of susceptibles.80

Epidemiologic studies in the eastern Mediterranean region report the prevalence of hypertension
up to 30% among adults in urban areas. In one
cross-sectional survey, Sarraf-Zadigan and Amininik studied 8639 men (n = 2505) and women (n = 3413) aged 19–70 years from Isfahan city (n = 7857) and surrounding rural areas (total n = 782, men = 178, women = 436).19 The prevalence of hypertension by new criteria (21 vs 7%, P Ͻ 0.01) as well as by old WHO criteria (27 vs 10, P Ͻ 0.01) were
signiﬁcantly greater in urban than rural subjects.
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures for vari-
ous age groups were also signiﬁcantly greater in
urban than in rural subjects (Tables 13 and 14). In
a more recent cross-sectional survey among 2200
subjects (1000 men and 1200 women) from Isfahan city,20 aged 19–70 years, the prevalence of hypertension (Ͼ160/95 mm Hg) was 16.8% in men and

sion at most age groups for men and women and it is also more common in higher social classes.
The Philippine Lipid Society and Philippine Society of Hypertension in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Research Institute conducted a nationwide survey in 1998–1999.103 The prevalence of hypertension (Ͼ140/90) (21%), smoking (46.6%), fasting hyperglycemia (Ͼ125 mg/dl) (41%), hypercholesterolemia (Ͼ200 mg/dl) (16%) or higher LDL cholesterol (Ͼ130 mg/dl) (22%), hypertriglyceridemia (Ͼ150 mg/dl) (18%) and low HDL (Ͻ35 mg/dl) (65%) were quite common in the population of 4541 subjects aged 20 years and above. Mean blood pressure was 124/79 mm Hg and mean blood glucose 88 mg/dl. Mean values for total cholesterol were 159 mg/dl, LDL-C 107 mg/dl. Triglycerides were 116 mg whereas HDL-C was 30 mg/dl, indicating that low HDL-C may be an important problem in the Philippines.
In Korea, disease patterns have changed from infectious disease to non-infectious disease in the 1970s. Since then, stroke has been the leading cause of death. National mortality data based on vital registration have been available since 1981. In 1998, stroke mortality per 100 000 population was 70.7 and 77.3 in males and females, respectively.104 During 1985–1998, age-adjusted stroke mortality rates showed a decreasing trend for both sexes.105 The decrease in the death rate was more prominent in males than in females. For males, it decreased 41% (from 70.7/100 000 to 41.6/100 000) and, for females, it decreased 30% (from 61.6/100 000 to 42.8/100 000).

In Korea, there were two nationwide blood pressure surveys which were performed in 1980 and 1990. During 1980–1990, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased signiﬁcantly in men and women.106 In 1990 prevalence of hypertension (140/90 mm Hg or more) among adults aged 30 years or more was 20.7% in males and 19.9% in females.107 There was no signiﬁcant differences in blood pressure levels between rural and urban areas. The proportion of hypertensives who were aware of hypertension was 27%, and among hypertensives, 28% treated their hypertension in 1990.107
Coronary artery disease has been the leading cause of mortality in Malaysia since the early 1980s.108,109 This is partly a reﬂection of the increasing prevalence of risk factors for coronary artery disease in the country over the same period. Surveys done in the 1980s revealed that the prevalence of hypertension (deﬁned as Ͼ160/95 mm Hg) was 14% in the state of Selangor110 and 14.4% in a nationwide survey (First National Health and Morbidity Survey Report, 1986). Meanwhile a survey done in the state of Kelantan in the mid 1990s showed that the prevalence of hypertension (Ͼ160/90 mm Hg) increased from 10.1% in those with normal weight to 13.1% in the overweight and 23.3% in the obese population.111 A Second National Health and Morbidity Survey completed in 1996112 meanwhile revealed that hypertension (Ͼ140/90 mm Hg) was present in 29.9% in adults age 30 years and above. The same survey also showed that 8.3% of Malaysians above 30 years old are diabetics (compared to 6.3% in 1986), 30.6% above the age of 18 had ever

Awareness and control
Awareness of hypertension among hypertensives has not been studied in the majority of the studies. Only 46 (11%) of men and 44 (16%) of women hypertensives were aware of their condition in a study by Gupta et al73 from Rajasthan, India. The Five City Study showed that the awareness was signiﬁcantly less at Moradabad and Nagpur compared to Calcutta (12% and 14% vs 22%, P Ͻ 0.05) where it was comparable with Bombay (24%) and Trivandrum (26%).16 Only half of the women who were known hypertensives were receiving drug therapy at various centres. In a recent study by Singh et al, only 50 patients were known hypertensives (32 men, 18 women) and of these, two-thirds were taking regular treatment.17 In another study90 among 7630 employees in a town, the prevalence of hypertension was 33.2% of 2535 hypertensives, only 559 (22.0%) were aware of their hypertension. The aware hypertensives were predominantly symptomatic, overweight and had higher age and blood pressure than the unaware hypertensives. In Pakistan 70% of the hypertensives were not aware of their hypertension.102
In international studies,99–101 the prevalence of unaware hypertensives among total patients of hypertension was 49% and 31% in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I and III

respectively.100 The prevalence of unaware hypertensives amongst the elderly was higher than that found in a Munich blood pressure study (27%).100,101 However, it was lower than that reported by Sharma et al60 in industrial workers (87.5%) and professionals (78.8%) in Ludhiana. The prevalence of unaware hypertensives in the Ͻ35 years age group was lower than a similar age group in urban Delhi, which was comparable with Gupta et al in Shimla.90 WHO also reported on the level of awareness among hypertensives from Bangladesh,113 China,87 India,53,60 Philippines,114 Sri Lanka115 compared to Finland in 1988116 based on earlier published studies.7 At the beginning of 1980, the same proportion of Chinese industrial workers87 knew about their hypertension as did men in Finland in 1972 (39%). Awareness has increased among Finnish patients of both sexes over the period of 1972– 82 to 67% in men and 87% in women.116 In a recent study, 27% of hypertensives were aware of their hypertension in the Philippines.107
It seems that the presence of symptoms and health education of the patient bring him to the doctor for a check-up, resulting in a diagnosis of hypertension. However, asymptomatic subjects in lower social classes remain undiagnosed hypertensives. A prevention programme for the control of cardiovascular disease in developing Asia is therefore linked to a policy relevant research agenda. Long-term cohort studies followed by intervention trials to initially identify and later modify risk factors appear to be time consuming for developing countries and are likely to be impeded by ﬁnancial constraints.117–119
