Abstract
The relationships between increases in body mass index (BMI) and increases in hypertension were compared between non-drinkers with elevated serum y-glutamyl transpeptidase (y-GTP) levels (250 U/l) and those with normal levels, who comprised 10,952 men and 22,107 women aged 40-59 years recruited from an occupational health clinic. Hypertension was found in 16.1% and 13.5% of the men and women, and elevated serum g-GTP was found in 10.8% and 2.8% of the men and women, respectively. The prevalences of hypertension and elevated serum yGTP levels were both increased with increased BMI. Hypertension was, however, shown to be 1.5 times more prevalent in the persons with elevated serum yGTP levels than in those with normal levels in both sexes, even after adjusting for BMI by a multiple logistic analysis. It can be concluded that elevations of serum y-GTP, which are probably a reflection of fatty liver in the non-drinkers, are closely related to the development of hypertension associated with increased obesity.

Introduction Obesity is often accompanied by hypertension. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the devel-
opment of hypertension in obese persons remain unclear, including the question of why only some obese persons develop hypertension and others do not (3,ll). During the last decade, much attention has been paid to

the role of dominant distribution of adipose tissue in the abdominal cavity of some obese persons, i.e., visceral type obesity (1,2,13), in the development of obesityrelated complications including hypertension. The development of hypertension in visceral type obesity is attributed to insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia (5). The details of the associations between visceral type obesity, insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension, however, remain to be elucidated by further investigations.
On the other hand, we have found a linear association between serumy-glutamyl transpeptidase(y-GTP) levels and blood pressure, not only in drinkers (15,17) but also in non-drinkers (16). Since the elevations of serum yGTP levels in non-drinkers mainly depend on increased obesity (8,16), these findings suggest that the rise in blood pressure in obese persons is closely related to the elevations of serum y-GTP levels. The rise in blood pressure may result in hypertension. However, the relationship between serum y-GTP .levels and the development of hypertension could not be determined in our previous study of non-drinkers (16) because of the limited size of the study population. The aim of the present study is, therefore, to elucidate the relationship in a large-scalemale and femalenon-drinkerpopulation.
Subjects and Methods The study population was recruited from workers who had undergone health check ups conducted during a one-year period at an occupational health check-up service facility. The total number of the participants was around 100,OOO (60,OOO men and 40,000 women) at the facility. Workers aged between 40-59 years who stated that they had not drunk at all, or had drunk a small volume (c 10 ml) of alcohol not more often than once a
month during the one-year period, were regarded as
essentially non-drinkers. The present study population, 10.952 men and 22,112 women, comprised about 20%

The results are summarized in Table 3. All of the variables, i.e., BMI, sex, and serum y-GTP levels, were significantly related to the probability of hypertension, and the odds ratios of hypertension were shown to be 1.13 in sex difference (menlwomen), and 1.51 in different serum y-GTP levels (elevatedhormal). The logistic curves of the increase in hypertension with increased
BMI obtained in the statistical results, for the men and
women with or without elevated serum y-GTP levels,
are illustrated in Figure 1.

Discussion Increases in the prevalence of hypertension with increases in BMI were observed in non-drinkers, both in
those with and without elevated serum y-GTP levels, but were higher at all levels of BMI in the persons with elevated serum y-GTP levels. These findings were basically common to both men and women, although men showed a slightly higher prevalence of hypertension than women. It can be said from these results that the levels of serum y-GTPare closely related to the devel-

The present non-drinkers included occasional drinkers who consumed a small volume of alcohol, not more often than once a month.

sure levels. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that our non-drinker group contained some drinkers who consumed more alcohol, because the selections were made by self-reported alcohol consumption data. However, we found a significant correlation
between serum y-GTPand blood pressure in the previ-
ous study on a smaller size non-drinker population (16),
where the subjects showing higher serum y-GTP levels
were carefully evaluated for alcohol consumption by interviews.
The present subjects may include some persons with elevated serum y-GTP due to causes other than alcohol consumption, such as hepatobiliary diseases or barbiturate use. However, the presence of these conditions, at least, could not exaggerate the association between elevated serum y-GTP and hypertension. Some possible artificial effects associated with the manner of measurement of body weight and blood pressure also were not thought to have influenced critically the present results showing a higher prevalence of hypertension in the subjects with higher serum y-GTP levels at all levels of BMI. Therefore, the present findings were thought to be basically valid.
As shown in Table 2 and Figure 1, the prevalences of hypertension were also elevated with increased BMI even in the subjects with normal serum y-GTP levels. The difference in the prevalence of hypertension between the two serum y-GTP levels seemed small, the ratio being around 1.3 in obese subjects with BMI of 30 kg/m2. However, it should be noted that the mean value of serum y-GTP levels in the obese subjects must be also higher even though the levels remained within normal limits.
