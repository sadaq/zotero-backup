Picture of Hypertension
Hypertension Illustration

Hypertension: High blood pressure , defined as a repeatedly elevated blood pressure exceeding 140 over 90 mmHg -- a systolic pressure above 140 or a diastolic pressure above 90.

Chronic hypertension is a "silent" condition. Stealthy as a cat, it can cause blood vessel changes in the back of the eye ( retina ), abnormal thickening of the heart muscle , kidney failure , and brain damage .

For diagnosis, there is no substitute for measurement of blood pressure. Not having your blood pressure checked (or checking it yourself) is an invitation to hypertension .

No specific cause for hypertension is found in 95% of cases.

Hypertension is treated with regular aerobic exercise , weight reduction (if overweight ), salt restriction, and medications.
