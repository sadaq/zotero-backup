Background: We aimed to investigate relationship between gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity with paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity and aortic stiffness (AS) parameters such as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx). Methods: Measurements were obtained from 324 patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension (mean age: 55.0 ± 8.2 years). The patients were divided into two groups according to their median GGT values. PWV and AIx were calculated using the singlepoint method via the Mobil-O-Graph R ARCsolver algorithm. Results: PWV, Aix, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)

values were higher and PON1 activity values were lower in GGThigh group compared with GGTlow group (P < 0.05, for all). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that GGT activity was independently associated with PWV (β = 0.496, P < 0.001) and PON1 activity (β = −0.343, P < 0.001) as well as hs-CRP (β = 0.334, P < 0.001). Conclusion: These results may support that increased GGT activity would be associated with both impaired antioxidant system and increased AS in hypertensive patients. J. Clin. Lab.

INTRODUCTION
Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity is a wellknown enzyme marker for increased oxidative stress (1,2). GGT activity is found on the surface of various cells including vascular system and plays a role in the catabolism of glutathione, which is one of the major antioxidants (1, 2). Previous studies have indicated that GGT is involved in the pathophysiologic process of atherosclerosis (3). Also, serum GGT concentrations within the physi-

ologic range have been independently related with most cardiovascular disease risk factors including metabolic

syndrome and hypertension (4–6). In particular, increased GGT activity has been shown to be associated with hypertension development in previous studies (5, 6).
Increased aortic stiffness (AS) reﬂects vascular damage and is a measure of the severity of atherosclerosis (7). Also, noninvasive AS is postulated to be a surrogate marker of early atherosclerosis (8). Moreover, AS is independently associated with hypertension (9). Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx), valid, clinically feasible, and reproducible measures of AS, generally allows the comprehensive assessment of patients with cardiovascular diseases (10).
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol exerts cardioprotective properties through its antioxidant activity and anti-inﬂammatory effects, which is largely maintained by paraoxonase 1 (PON1) (11, 12). PON1 protects lipoproteins against oxidative modiﬁcation and to hydrolyze hydrogen peroxide, a major reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced under conditions of inﬂammation and atherosclerosis (12).
Our hypothesis is that GGT activity, which reﬂects increased oxidative stress, is associated with PON1 activity (antioxidant enzyme) and AS, which is related with essential hypertension. Therefore, we aimed to investigate relationship between GGT activity with PON1 activity and AS parameters such as PWV and AIx in patients with newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.

BP Measurement and ABPM
BP was measured by using a mercury sphygmomanometer in ofﬁce setting. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic BPs (DBP) were taken. Noninvasive 24-h ABPM was performed with a portable compact digital recorder (Tracker NIBP2, Delmar Reynolds Ltd., Hertford, UK), and analyzed using a customized analytical software (Delmar Reynolds Medical Inc., Model 2169, Hertford, UK). All subjects wore an ABPM device for a single 24-h period. The device was programmed to inﬂate and record BP at prespeciﬁed intervals (every 15 min during daytime hours and every 30 min during nighttime hours), which provided approximately 80 BP recordings during the 24-h period.
Diagnosis of Hypertension
In each subject, BP was measured in at least three separate days after 15 min of comfortably sitting and averaged. Then each subject undertook 24-h ABPM. Individuals who had SBP ࣙ 140 mmHg and/or a DBP ࣙ 90 mmHg in ofﬁce setting, and in ABPM, an average 24-h SBP > 130 mmHg and/or DBP > 80 mmHg, an average daytime SBP > 135 mmHg and/or DBP > 85 mmHg or an average nighttime SBP > 125 mmHg and/or DBP > 75 mmHg were diagnosed as hypertensive (13).
Blood Samples and Echocardiography

METHODS
Study Populations
Of 359 patients having ofﬁce blood pressure (BP) measurement ࣙ140/90mmHg, 35 patients were excluded because of their BP was normal according to ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Measurements were obtained from 324 patients with newly diagnosed essential hypertension (mean age: 55.0 ± 8.2 years, male/female: 125/199). The study population was divided into two subgroups as GGTlow versus GGThigh groups with regard to their median GGT levels. Exclusion criteria were secondary hypertension, heart failure, positive history or clinical signs of ischemic heart disease, positive effort test, positive myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, cerebrovascular disease, severe valve disease, atrial ﬁbrillation, usage of any drugs, renal insufﬁciency (serum creatinine: ࣙ1.5 mg/dl in men and ࣙ1.4 mg/dl in women), major noncardiovascular diseases, and known diabetes or fasting glucose ࣙ126 mg/dl. In addition, patients taking antioxidant vitamin and alcohol were also excluded. The Local Ethics Committee assessed and approved the study and written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all individuals.

Fasting blood samples were collected after the examination for the evaluation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, GGT activity, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. Plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL concentrations, and fasting glucose were measured using an automated chemistry analyzer (Aeroset; Abbott, Holliston, MN) with commercial kits (Abbott). Hs-CRP was measured using an autoanalyzer (Aeroset; Abbott) with a spectrophotometric commercial kit (Scil Diagnostics GmbH, Viernheim, Germany). Serum GGT activities were measured by the enzymatic calorimetric test (Roche/Hitachi analyzer, Mannheim, Germany) and the normal range of GGT activity was identiﬁed as 7–49 U/l. The coefﬁcient of variation (CV) for measurement of serum GGT activity was 2%.
Measurement of serum PON1 activity was performed in the absence of NaCl (basal activity). The rate of paraoxon hydrolysis (diethyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate) was measured by monitoring the increase of absorbency at 412 nm at 37°C. The amount of generated p-nitrophenol was calculated from the molar absorptivity coefﬁcient at pH 8, which was 17,000 M−1 cm−1 (14). PON1 activity was expressed as U/l serum. The CV for measurement of serum PON activity was 2.3%.

Standard two-dimensional echocardiography was performed using a commercially available echocardiographic machine (Vivid 7R GE Medical System, Horten, Norway) with a 2.0–3.5 MHz transducer. Left Ventricle ejection fraction was determined by the biplane Simpson’s method (15).
The ARC Solver Method
The ARC Solver method is commercially available in the oscillometric Mobil-O-Graph NGW 24-h PWA monitor (IEM; Stolberg, Germany) and aims to be a novel method for the determination of the aortic SBP, aortic BP curves, and AIx based on oscillometric BP measurement. The method (16) has been developed by the Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria. The method uses the pulse waves assessed at arteria brachialis. The algorithm for the generation of, using the oscillometric method, have been reported previously (16,17) but are brieﬂy explained. After the conventional oscillometric BP assessment, peripheral pressure waves are recorded, using the appropriately sized brachial cuff and a high ﬁdelity pressure sensor (MPX5050, Freescale Inc., Tempe, AZ), at DBP level for 10 sec. The sensor is connected to a 12 bit A/D converter by means of an active analogue band bass ﬁlter (0.425 Hz). Following digitalization, the signal processing is performed using a three-step algorithm. In a ﬁrst step, the single pressure waves are veriﬁed for their plausibility by testing the position of minima and the corresponding wavelengths. Minima are detected by means of an iterative procedure evaluating higher order time derivatives of the pressure signal. The second stage involves comparison of all single pressure waves with one another to recognize artifacts. Aortic pulse waves are then generated via a general transfer function. Modulus and phase characteristics of the ARC Solver transfer function are available. Finally, the coherence of the measured parameters is veriﬁed and displayed within the Mobil-O-Graph NG software package, which also allows visual inspection to unveil consistently recorded intrinsic waveform distortion manually.
Measurements of the Aortic PWV and AIx
All recordings were performed with the ARC Solver method and standard oscillometric BP measurement procedures. After 10 min of rest, an appropriately sized BP cuff was attached to the patient’s right arm. Applanation tonometry of the radial artery and oscillometric pulse wave recordings at the brachial artery were performed in the supine position. This was followed by a 10-sec pulsed wave analysis recording with the cuff inﬂated at the DBP level.
Using the Mobil-O-Graph NG, the aortic BP curves, aortic SBP, and aortic pulse pressure (aPP: aortic SBP −

aortic DBP) were obtained. A characteristic point of the aortic BP curve, the inﬂection point, is identiﬁed within the time domain, indicating the arrival of the reﬂected wave in the ascending aorta. The BP at this point of time is called “inﬂection pressure.” The difference between aortic SBP and inﬂection pressure is called “augmentation pressure” (AP). The AIx is then calculated by AP/aPP × 100. The Mobil-O-Graph NG software package allows us to automatically calculate aortic PWV and AIx (17).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data are expressed as mean value ± SD. Continuous variables were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. An independent simple t-test was used in the analysis of continuous variables. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. The correlations between GGT and laboratory, AS parameters, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic parameters were assessed by the Pearson correlation test. A multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify the independent associations of GGT activity. All signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) parameters in the bivariate analysis (Average 24-h SBP, Ofﬁce SBP, AIx, PWV, hs-CRP, PON1 activity) were selected in the multivariate model. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
The patients were divided into two subgroups as GGTlow (mean age: 54.7 ± 6.4; 162 patients) versus GGThigh (mean age: 55.3 ± 9.8; 162 patients) groups with regard to their median GGT levels (GGTlow < 27.3 U/l and GGThigh ࣙ 27.3 groups).
Comparison of baseline and laboratory characteristics was demonstrated in Table 1. Both average 24-h SBP and ofﬁce SBP values were higher in GGThigh group compared with GGTlow group (P < 0.05, for all). Other baseline characteristics were not different between the groups (P > 0.05, for all). PON1 activity levels of GGThigh group were higher than GGTlow group (P < 0.05). Similarly, hs-CRP levels were higher in GGThigh group compared with GGTlow group (P < 0.05).
PWV and AIx values were higher in GGThigh group compared with GGTlow group (P < 0.05, for all) (Table 1).
GGT activity was signiﬁcantly associated with ofﬁce SBP (r = 0.112, P = 0.043), average 24-h SBP (r = 0.176, P = 0.002), AIx (r = 0.188, P = 0.001), PWV (r = 0.624, P < 0.001), hs-CRP (r = 0.509, P < 0.001), PON1 activity (r = −0.558, P < 0.001) in bivariate analysis (Table 2). Relationships between GGT activity with PON1 and PWV were shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Multivariate regression analysis showed that GGT activity was independently associated with PWV (β = 0.496, P < 0.001), hs-CRP (β = 0.334, P < 0.001), and PON1 activity (β = −0.343, P < 0.001) (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst study that investigated the relationship between GGT activity with PON1 activity and AS in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. The main ﬁnding of the present study was that GGT activity was independently associated with PON1 activity and PWV as well as hs-CRP in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.
It is well known that there is an independent association between GGT activity and hypertension (5, 6). Moreover, GGT activity is positively associated with the development of hypertension (5, 6).
Present study showed that GGT activity within the normal range was independently and negatively associated with PON1 activity. Hypertension is associated with

increased vascular production of ROS (18, 19). Vascular oxidant stress, particularly interactions between nitric oxide and oxygen derived radicals, represents a common pathologic mechanism in many risk factors for atherosclerosis including hypertension (19). GGT has been proposed as a marker of oxidative stress (1,2). Previous experimental studies have reported that GGT plays an important role in antioxidant systems with the primary function of maintaining intracellular concentrations of glutathione, a critical antioxidant defense for the cell (20,21). Also, it was shown that GGT activities within the reference range catalyze oxidative reactions in the presence of iron ions that lead to the production of free radicals and ROS and LDL oxidation (22). Oxidative stress, owing to increased lipid and protein oxidation products and decreased antioxidant enzymes and vitamins, affects PON1 expression and activities (23). There is direct evidence for a mechanistic link between activity of PON1 with systemic oxidative stress and prospective cardiovascular risk, indicating a potential mechanism for the atheroprotective function of PON1 (24). Fallah et al. showed PON1 192 genes potentially play a role in the manifestation of coronary atherosclerosis (25). These ﬁndings shows that serum PON1 activity is inhibited by increased oxidative stress (23,24). It has been assumed that antioxidants such as PON1, which physiologically protect against excess of ROS, are consumed, thereby further increasing ROS induced damage (26). Therefore, the inverse relationship between GGT activity and PON1 activity (antioxidant enzyme) may be plausible because GGT activity is associated with oxidative stress.
Present study also showed that GGT activity was independently associated with PWV, with reproducible measures of AS. The relationship between GGT activity and AS was investigated in various patient groups (27, 31). However, this relationship was not investigated in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients. Saijo et al. reported that GGT was independently related to an increased level of arterial stiffness in male patients who were examined for routine checkup (27). Song et al. suggested that serum GGT activity may be an additional marker of arterial stiffness, especially in men, though the relationship with arterial stiffness was weak (28). Jung et al. demonstrated that GGT activity in healthy subjects was independently associated with the increased level of arterial stiffness both in men and women, even it was stronger in men (28). Also, the similar relationship between GGT activity and arterial stiffness was shown in patients with established coronary artery disease and in young patients with prehypertension (30, 31). The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between GGT activity with increased AS are unclear. GGT levels were found to be associated with subclinical aortic atherosclerosis (32). Fur-

thermore, higher serum GGT activity has been reported in atherosclerotic plaques and foam cells (33). Moreover, GGT contributes to oxidative stress pathways in several organ systems, localizes to atheromatous plaques containing oxidized LDL, and is proinﬂammatory, further implicating this protein in atherogenesis (34). On the other hand, the association between increased AS with oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and subclinical atherosclerosis has been demonstrated in previous studies (35,36). Therefore, increased GGT activity may reﬂect to increased oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and subclinical atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients with increased AS. In present study, the independent relationship between GGT activity with hs-CRP and PON1 activity may support this hypothesis.
Present study showed that GGT activity was also independently associated with hs-CRP levels. This result is consistent with previous studies (27,34,37). Previous studies have reported a signiﬁcant association between serum GGT and CRP levels after adjustment for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI (1). Moreover, CRP has been found to be deposited in coronary artery plaque, and it has a pro-oxidative effect on cultured coronary artery smooth muscle cells (37). Therefore, it was suggested that the signiﬁcant relationship between GGT and CRP may possibly be due to their association with oxidative stress (27).
Study Limitations
Coronary atherosclerosis may affect GGT and PON1 activities in this patient group. Coronary angiography was not performed in our patients although patients with coronary artery disease have been excluded according to clinical characteristics and patient history, electrocardiography, and treadmill exercise test. Also, smoking may be effective on PON1 activity and AS. However, smoking frequencies of groups were not different and there was no correlation between GGT activity and smoking frequency in our study. Furthermore, in present study, there was an independent relationship between GGT activity with AS and PON1 activity.
Finally, in present study, PON1 phenotype or genotype was not determined. PON1 has two coding region amino acid polymorphisms, one at position 55 and another at position 192 (38). The Q192R polymorphism has such a signiﬁcant effect on PON1 activity. It is possible, but not advisable, to use paraoxonase activity within a 192 genotype/phenotype (e.g., Q/Q, Q/R, or R/R). Also, it was reported that serum PON1 activity is a better predictor of the risk for cardiovascular diseases than the PON1 genotype (39).

CONCLUSIONS
In hypertensive patients, GGT activity was independently associated with PON1 activity and PWV as well as hs-CRP. These results may support that increased GGT activity would be associated with both impaired antioxidant system and increased AS in hypertensive patients.
