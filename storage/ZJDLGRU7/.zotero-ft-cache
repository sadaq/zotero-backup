Preparation and Properties of a Cholesterol Oxidase from Nocardia sp. and Its Application to the Enzymatic Assay of Total Cholesterol in Serum

W. Richmond

I describe the characterization, extraction, and puri-

fication of a cholesterol:oxygen oxidoreductase (EC

1.1.3.6) from Nocardia sp. This enzyme catalyzes

oxidation of cholesterol to z4-choIestenone, with

production of hydrogen peroxide. It is very stable,

active over a wide pH range, and has a Km of 1.4 X

i0 mol/liter. It is highly specific for - or

3f3-hydroxycholestanes,

and may be applied to the

assay of serum total cholesterol. In the procedure

presented here, hydrogen peroxide is measured by

reaction with quadrivalent titanium and xylenol or-

ange. This constitutes a one-enzyme assay with sta-

ble reagents, which does not require protein precipi-

tation and is not subject to interference from hemo-

globin or bilirubin.

Fifty grams of the exchange resin “DE52” (pre-

Whatman, Maidstone, Eng-

land) was equilibrated

with tris(hydroxymethyl)-

hydrochloride buffer (10 mmol/liter,

pH 8.0) containing 10 ml of Triton X-100 per liter,

and packed in a 2.0-cm (i.d.) column to a bed height

of 3.0 cm. Five milliliters of the cell extract was ap-

plied, and stepwise elution was carried out with

15-mi portions of tris( hydroxymethyl )aminomethane

chloride buffer (pH 8.0) in the sequence of molarities

0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mol/liter. Five-millili-

ter fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/

mm. Of the total cholesterol oxidase activity, 50%

was eluted in the second and third fractions collected

during elution with 0.3 mol/liter buffer. These frac-

tions were free of catalase activity, which remained

bound to the resin, and the cholesterol oxidase activ-

ity was increased fourfold by this procedure.

A large-scale process based on these studies has

been developed. Culture of the organism has also

been optimized and the cholesterol oxidase activity

of the organism increased by induction with choles-

terol (ii).

The crude enzyme preparations obtained from me-

chanically ruptured cells presented a more difficult

purification problem, which was solved by using a

form of substrate-affinity

chromatography.

“Sepha-

dex LH-20” (Pharmacia,

Uppsala, Sweden) was

swollen in a saturated ethanolic solution of choles-

terol. A slurry prepared in this manner was packed

into a column, which was then washed with distilled

water to precipitate cholesterol throughout the gel. It

was then equilibrated

with potassium phosphate

buffer (50 mmol/liter, pH 7.5). Crude cell extract

was applied to the column and eluted with the same

buffer. Most of the protein was eluted immediately,

but cholesterol oxidase, retarded by its affinity for

cholesterol trapped in the gel, was eluted later. With

this technique,

a 100-fold purification

could be

achieved. Purification by detergent extraction or ion-

exchange proved, however, to be much simpler and

it was uneconomic to pursue mechanical disruption

and substrate affinity chromatography

on a large

scale.

Characterization of the Enzyme

It was considered essential to establish the nature

of the hydrogen acceptor involved in the enzymatic

oxidation of cholesterol to 4-cholestenone.

The enzyme was precipitated

from cell-free ex-

tracts at 52% saturation with ammonium sulfate (at

4 #{176w}Cith) out undue loss of activity. This suggested

that loosely bound nicotinamide coenzymes were not

involved. Furthermore,

using a Clark oxygen elec-

trode (Radiometer,

Copenhagen,

Denmark),

we

demonstrated

oxygen consumption during the oxida-

tion of cholesterol by cell-free extracts, and it seemed

likely that the enzyme was an oxygen oxidoreduc-

tase, which would produce hydrogen peroxide as a

reaction product.

This was confirmed with both intact cells and cell-

free extracts by using a peroxidase/4-aminophena-

zone/phenol system (14) to detect hydrogen perox-

ide. Interference

from catalase activity in these

unpurified preparations was anticipated and avoided

by using a reagent with high peroxidase activity and

containing sodium azide, a potent catalase inhibitor.

Typical experimental details were as follows:

Washed Nocardia cells were suspended to a con-

centration of 10 mg (wet weight) per milliliter in a

reagent containing, per liter, 400 mg of 4-aminophe-

nazone, 200 mg of peroxidase (“R.Z.O.6”; Hughes

and Hughes, Romford, England), 1.2 g of phenol,

and 1.0 g of sodium azide. Portions of the cell sus-

pensions (2.0 ml) were placed in 20-ml vials; to the

test, 0.1 ml of a 10 g/liter solution of cholesterol in

ethanol was added while 0.1 ml of ethanol was added

to the control tube. The bott1es were flushed with

oxygen, stoppered, and incubated at 37 #{176fo}rC 30

mm with shaking. A deep pink color developed in

the test supernate, but only a faint pink color in the

control. Using purified enzyme preparations,

under

the conditions specified for the assay of serum cho-

lesterol, we demonstrated that 90% of the theoretical

yield of hydrogen peroxide was obtained from choles-

terol standards in isopropanol, assuming that one

molecule of hydrogen peroxide is produced for each

molecule of cholesterol oxidized.

Assay of Enzyme Activity

The insolubility of cholesterol and of z4-cholesten-

one caused difficulty in the development of direct

spectrophotometric

assays for both cholesterol oxi-

dase and serum cholesterol. We found, however, that

cholesterol could be satisfactorily solubilized by add-

ing an ethanolic solution of cholesterol to an aqueous

solution of Triton X-100, and that the z4-cholesten-

one produced by enzymatic oxidation remained in

solution. The rate at which cholesterol was converted

to i.4-cholestenone

could then be followed directly by

measuring the rate of increase in absorbance at 240

nm. (The contribution of hydrogen peroxide to the

absorbance change at this wavelength is negligible.)

The following procedure for the assay of cholester-

ol oxidase was suitable for enzyme preparations that

had been adjusted to an activity of about 2.0 U/mi

(one unit of activity = 1 imole of cholesterol oxi-

dized per minute under the conditions given):

To 3.0 ml of phosphate buffer (Q.1 mol/liter, pH

7.0) containing 0.5 ml of Triton X-100 per liter, at 30

enzyme preparation and mix by inversion. In a dou-

terol in isopropanol (6.0 mmol/liter), and mix again.

ethanolic solutions containing as much as 300 ml of

ethanol per liter, and in buffers ranging from pH 4.0

to pH 9.0; its activity was maximal at pH 7.0. The

Michaelis constant with the assay conditions de-

scribed was found to be 1.4 X 10 mol/liter.

Specificity. The specificity of the enzyme was in-

vestigated by comparing the rates of oxidation of

cholesterol analogs with that of cholesterol at the

same molarity, assuming that the z4-3-oxo products

would have the same molar absorptivities

as does

z4-cholestenone.

From the data in Table 2, it ap-

pears that the enzyme is specific for 3-stero’s and

requires a double bond in the z5- or 4-positions.

Shortening the cholesterol side chain markedly di-

minishes the affinity of the enzyme for these sub-

strates. The concentrations of potentially interfering

Rates of enzymic oxidation were measured by substituting the sterols for cholesterol in the assay of cholesterol oxidase. it was assumed that 4-3-oxo product would have the same molar absorptivity as &-cholestenone.
The rate of enzymic oxidation is expressed as a percentage of the rate of oxidation of cholesterol at the same molarity.

physiological sterols in serum are therefore less than

0.001 that of cholesterol.

These properties make the enzyme very suitable as an analytical reagent. Several approaches to the

assay of cholesterol in serum are therefore possible:

of oxygen consumption

with an

oxygen electrode

#{1m49e}asurement of hydrogen peroxide production,

enzymatically or otherwise

#{1m49e}asurement of 4-cholestenone,

either directly

or as a derivative.

We prefer to measure hydrogen peroxide produc-

tion because this approach is most likely to produce

an easily automated coloiimetric assay. The color

reaction of choice is the direct formation of a chelate

complex of hydrogen peroxide with quadrivalent ti-

tanium and xylenol orange (15), because this pro-

vides an inexpensive, one-enzyme system with very

stable reagents and a fast, specific, and stable color

reaction.

Assay of Total Cholesterol in Serum

Principle. Cholesterol is released from lipoprotein

complexes and hydrolyzed from its esters by alkali.

After neutralization,

the hydrolysate is treated with

mercuric ions to remove interfering reducing sub-

stances generated in the saponification step. The lib-

erated cholesterol, held in solution by Triton X-100,

is subsequently oxidized to 4-cholestenone

with the

simultaneous

production

of hydrogen

peroxide,

which is chelated with xylenol orange and quadri-

valent titanium. The absorption of the complex is

measured at 550 nm vs. a reagent blank in which a

solution of’ bovine serum albumin in water (70 g/

liter) replaces serum.

Optimization

of procedure. In the saponification

step, a 1.0 molar concentration of alkali is required,

to keep protein in solution. All the cholesterol esters

are hydrolyzed by incubation for 5 mm at 75 #{176a}sC,

shown by thin-layer chromatography.

With most

sera a light precipitate forms, but this redissolves

completely at the neutralization

stage. Although the

ethanolic alkali contains 50 ml of Triton X-100 per

liter, this is subsequently diluted to 3.5 mi/liter; at

CLINICAL CHEMISTRY, Vol. 19, No. 12.1973 1353

this concentration,

protein and cholesterol are main-

tained in solution and the reaction is not inhibited.

In neutralizing the hydrolysate, the pH must be

maintained above 7.5 to prevent formation of a pre-

cipitate when mercuric chloride is added. It is thus

necessary to buffer the neutralizing reagent, but

buffer concentration

must be kept low to prevent

formation of a precipitate when the titanium-xylenol

orange, reagent is subsequently added. Tris(hydroxy-

methyl)aminomethane

phosphate, which was includ-

ed in the neutralizing reagent, was found to main-

tain the pH satisfactorily between pH 7.5 and 7.8.

After saponification

and neutralization

of serum or

“Serachol” reference serum (William R. Warner Ltd,

Eastleigh, England) samples, reducing substances

were demonstrably

present equivalent to approxi-

mately 0.4 zmol of hydrogen peroxide per milliliter.

These substances were not formed when reagent

blanks or cholesterol standards in isopropanol were

substituted for serum, and it was necessary to re-

move them before enzymatic oxidation in order to

prevent underestimation

of’ total cholesterol in

serum. They were removed by adding excess hydro-

gen peroxide after neutralizing

the saponification

mixture. Residual peroxide was then destroyed by

brief incubation with catalase, which was in turn in-

hibited with sodium azide before effecting the enzy-

matic oxidation of cholesterol. We expected that this

procedure would overcome potential interference and

have the added advantage that oxygen generated by

the action of catalase on excess peroxide might acti-

vate the cholesterol oxidase system. In practice, re-

producibility

proved to be poor, and further work

showed that interfering reducing substances could be

removed more effectively by oxidation with mercuric

chloride. Mercuric ions strongly inhibit cholesterol

oxidase; this effect may be removed by adding sodi-

um azide, which also serves as a catalase inhibitor

and probably is effective because mercuric azide is

formed; this cannot inhibit the enzyme. Figure 3 in-

dicates the concentration of mercuric ions required

for complete removal of’ interfering reducing sub-

stances, and hence maximal color development,

when Serachol samples were taken through the assay

procedure.

Figure 4 demonstrates

the pH dependence of the

color reaction. The composition of the combined

color reagent has been selected to produce a final pH

of 1.15 which gives adequate sensitivity without creat-

ing the solubility problems that arise at higher pH

values. The color reaction has been shown to be lin-

ear up to 20 mmol of’ cholesterol per liter.

With the conditions specified, 0.25 U of cholesterol oxidase in a reaction volume of 1.25 ml is sufficient

to effect complete oxidation, within 5 mm, of sam-

ples containing as much as 20 mmol of cholesterol

per liter (773 mg/dl).

Reagents

Ethanolic KOH, 1 mol/liter. Triton X-100 (50 ml)

is mixed with about 600 ml of ethanol (reagent

to make 1.0 liter of 1 mol/liter KOH, is added and

the mixture diluted to 1.0 liter with more ethanol.

not encountered when serum is used as the sample.

Although cholesterol oxidase can be prepared cat-

alase free, the presence of azide in the assay system

safeguards against catalase interference arising from

this source or from bacterial contamination

of re-

agents.

To investigate the effects of hemoglobin and bili-

rubin on the enzymic assay, we prepared a fresh pool

of plasma containing 0.5 mg of’ bilirubin per deciliter

and no detectable hemoglobin. Bilirubin dissolved in

dimethyl sulf’oxide (19) was added to a portion of the

pool to give a stock solution containing 25 mg of bili-

rubin per deciliter. This stock was then diluted with

plasma, to which an equivalent amount of dimethyl

sulfoxide had been added, to give solutions ranging

from 0.5 to 25 mg of bilirubin/dl.

Plasma specimens with hemoglobin concentrations

ranging from zero to 200 mg/dl were prepared from a

hernolysate of erythrocytes. The plasma diluent was

prepared by adding an equivalent amount of phys-

iological saline to a portion of the pool.

The plasma samples containing added bilirubin or

hemoglobin were then assayed for cholesterol by our

technique, with the plasma diluent in each case serv-

ing as a baseline value. The results (Table 3) show

that bilirubin and hemoglobin have no effect on the

results of’ the assay, even at the highest concentra-

tions examined.

Discussion

The present findings strongly suggest that the en-

zymatic method described here would be more spe-

cific and precise in routine use than are conventional

techniques. Moreover, the assay system does not con-

tain highly corrosive reagents-a

distinct advantage

for automation. Hydrogen peroxide chelation, how-

ever, is only one of’ the many possible approaches to

the assay of’ serum cholesterol by use of this robust

enzyme. Peroxidase/oxygen

acceptor systems are

under investigation and have been shown to be com-

patible with the above reaction conditions. Automa-

tion of the assay with both continuous and discrete

systems is also under development.
