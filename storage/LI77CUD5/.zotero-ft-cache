Abstract
This study was designed to answer the following questions: (i) Do levels of serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), a marker of oxidative stress, change in hypertensive retinopathy (HR)? (ii) Is there any relation between degree of HR and GGT levels? This study included 80 hypertensive patients with HR. Group 1 comprised 40 patients with grade I HR, and group 2 comprised 40 patients with grade II HR. We selected 40 healthy subjects for the control group. Level of GGT in group 2 was significantly higher than in group 1 (P = 0.005) and control group (P = 0.001); it was also higher in group 1 than in control group (P = 0.025). Our study suggests that oxidative stress, mechanisms known to be involved in vascular lesions, may promote the development of HR.
Keywords: gamma-glutamyl transferase, oxidative stress, hypertension, hypertensive retinopathy

BACKGROUND
Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a plasma membrane enzyme with a central role in glutathione homeostasis, which is important in maintaining adequate concentrations of intracellular glutathione to protect cells against oxidants. Elevated serum GGT activity is a sensitive marker of oxidative stress (1). Serum GGT is a clinical marker of several factors: hepatobiliary disease, alcohol consumption, body fat content, plasma lipid/ lipoproteins and glucose levels, and medications (2,3). Serum GGT can also reflect other concomitant risk factors such as hypertension (4,5), diabetes mellitus (6,7), obesity (8), dislipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (9). In addition, some studies demonstrated that there is a relationship between diabetic retinopathy and GGT levels (10).
Hypertensive retinopathy (HR) is a condition characterized by a spectrum of retinal vascular signs in people with elevated blood pressure (BP) (11–13). The pathophysiological mechanism of HR is not fully established. Elevated BP alone does not fully account for the extent of retinopathy, other pathogenic mechanisms may be involved, such as increased oxidative stress. Therefore, this study was designed to answer the following questions: (i) Do GGT levels change in HR? (ii) Is there any relation between degree of HR and GGT levels?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients This study was performed at the outpatients’ clinic of Department of Internal Medicine of Akdeniz University Hospital. Six hundred and fifty-four adult hypertensive patients were registered in the computer files of our departments. Eighty hypertensive patients without exclusion criteria were invited to participate in this study. None of the patients refused the study. The hypertensive patients were divided into two groups according to the Keith–Wagener classification (14). Group 1 comprised 40 hypertensive patients with grade I HR and group 2 comprised 40 hypertensive patients with grade II HR. Forty normotensive subjects, who were healthy participants and had undergone the checkup program, were used as the control group. The controls had similar body mass index (BMI), age, and sex distribution as the hypertensive group.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: stage 2 hypertension (according to the Eighth Report of the Joint National Committee) with BP > 160/100 mm Hg (15), grades 3 and 4 HR according to the Keith–Wagener Classification (as most of the patients had other complications that could interfere with the GGT results), diabetes mellitus, smoking, alcohol intake more than 30 g/day, hepatitis B or C infection or other known liver diseases, liver enzymes exceeding three times the upper reference range, use of hepatotoxic drugs,

dyslipidemia, obesity (BMI ! 30 kg/m2), cardiac, renal, cerebral, and other systemic diseases, recent major surgery or illness.
Dyslipidemia was defined in the presence of at least one of the following conditions: raised plasma triglycerides (>200 mg/dL), total cholesterol (>200 mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (>130 mg/ dL), and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)cholesterol (<40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women) (16).
Eligible subjects underwent a comprehensive assessment including documentation of medical history, physical examination, and measurement of laboratory variables. Body weight and height were measured with the subjects in light clothes and without shoes. Body mass index was calculated as the weight (kg)/height squared (m2). The resting electrocardiograms of all the subjects were normal. All patients gave their informed consent to participate in the study.
Measurement of BP Arterial BP was measured by a mercury sphygmomanometer after the patient had been in a sitting position for 5 minutes. For each subject, we recorded the average of three readings obtained within 5 minutes. Hypertension was defined as SBP (systolic BP) ! 140 mm Hg or DBP (diastolic BP) ! 90 mm Hg, as recommended in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (15).
Fundoscopic Examination For the HR evaluation, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy was performed in all subjects after dilatation of the pupils. A single-blinded observer performed the fundoscopic examinations. The grade of HR was determined according to the Keith–Wagener classification (14).
Biochemical Measurements Blood samples were collected from antecubital vein without the use of a tourniquet, between 08.30 and 09.00 hours, after an overnight fast to avoid the differences of diurnal variation. Enzymatic colorimetric assay method (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used to measure triglyceride, cholesterol, and highdensity lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level was calculated according to the Friedewald formula (17). Fasting glucose level was measured using the enzymatic colorimetric assay method (GLU, Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Serum GGT is measured colorimetrically using nitroanilide method on a Cobas instrument (Roche Diagnostics GmbH).
Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was done using SPSS statistical software (SPSS for Windows 16.0, Chicago, IL, USA). For a ¼ 0.05 (between each group) and a

power of 80%, a sample size per group >31 subjects was needed to detect an actual difference. The normality of the distribution was checked by stem and leaf plots. Gamma-glutamyl transferase values across groups were compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the post hoc Bonferroni test. In addition, Pearson’s correlation was used to evaluate the association between GGT and degree of HR. Summary data for GGT and other continuous variables are expressed as mean Æ SD. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.
RESULTS
The main characteristics, BPs, and laboratory results of study populations are reported in Table 1. Age, gender distribution, and BMI did not differ among the groups. Similarly, metabolic parameters were not different among the study groups as a result of the selection process.
The level of GGT in group 2 was significantly higher than in group 1 (30.57 Æ 6.01 U/L vs. 26.57 Æ 6.25 U/L, P ¼ .004) and normotensive control group (30.57 Æ 6.01 U/L vs. 23.27 Æ 3.94 U/L, P ¼ .001); it was also higher in group 1 than in normotensive control group (26.57 Æ 6.25 U/L vs. 23.27 Æ 3.94 U/L, P ¼ .025). In addition, GGT showed positive correlation with degree of HR in hypertensive group (r ¼ 0.309, P ¼ .004).
DISCUSSION
Recent epidemiologic and clinical studies have reported a strong association between GGT, a commonly used biochemical liver test, and hypertension. This association has been shown to be independent of alcohol consumption and to be present among both drinkers and nondrinkers (18,19). Our findings are consistent with previous work. On the contrary, this is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, specifically, to evaluate GGT levels in hypertensive patients with HR. Our study demonstrates that hypertensive patients with retinopathy have increased GGT activity, a marker of oxidative stress. In addition, GGT levels showed positive correlations with a degree of HR in hypertensive group.
Recent studies suggest that excessive production of reactive oxygen species, outstripping endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, may be involved in the pathogenesis and complications of hypertension (20– 22). Giner et al. (23) reported that oxidative stress is a determinant of microalbuminuria independent BP levels in hypertensive patients. Minuz et al. (24) demonstrated increased oxidative stress and persistent platelet activation in essential hypertension with advanced vascular lesions. Purushothaman et al. (25) reported that oxidative stress promotes left ventricular hypertrophy.

Hypertensive retinopathy is an important complication and a major site of target organ damage from hypertension. It is known that the autoregulation of the retinal circulation fails as BP increases beyond a critical limit. However, elevated BP alone does not fully account for the extent of HR (26–28). There are cases in which retinopathy was resolved despite the persistence of high BP (29). Although the BP levels in group 1 and group 2 were similar, levels of GGT were higher in group 2 than in group 1 in our study. Thus, the presence of high GGT levels in HR and the correlation of the amount of GGT with the severity of HR imply that oxidative stress may be involved in the mechanism of HR. Moreover, recently we found that there is a relationship between levels of ferritin, a marker of oxidative stress, and HR in essential hypertension (30).
This study has some limitations. Firstly, we accept that our study is a case–control design; it is not easy to predict exactly whether the high GGT levels precede retinopathy or vice versa. Future cohort studies will be helpful in providing an answer. Secondly, the study was conducted while the patients were taking antihypertensive treatment. However, distribution of drug use was similar in both hypertensive groups. Thirdly, grade 1–2 HR is not specific to hypertension.
CONCLUSION
Our study suggests that there is a relationship between HR and GGT levels in essential hypertension. Oxidative stress, mechanisms known to be involved in vascular lesions, may promote the development of HR. Also upcoming studies will point out whether or not GGT is a predictor of hypertensive vascular outcomes.
